<h2 id="title-chipping-away-writers-block-date-2019-07-23">title: Chipping Away Writer's Block date: 2019-07-23</h2>
<p>I had a conversation a few weeks ago with my project manager, <a href="https://github.com/seefeldb">Bernhard Seefeld</a>, about strategies to combat writer's block. At the time, I had been taking longer than I would like to write documentation. I asked him how he deals with writer's block. He gave me some great advice, which I thought was worthy of sharing.</p>
<h2 id="cant-start-a-draft-send-an-email">Can't start a draft? Send an email</h2>
<p>A crafty use of psychology: sitting down and <em>writing</em> can seem like such a drag. Can't you just briefly <em>explain</em> the idea to someone? Why not pretend to (or actually) <a href="/emails/">send someone an email</a> where you talk about what you're going to write.</p>
<p>Viola! You have your first draft.</p>
<h2 id="draw-a-diagram-convert-it-to-text">Draw a diagram, convert it to text</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the linear nature of writing gets in the way of the expression of your ideas.</p>
<p>People will <em>read</em> your idea from start to finish, but that often is not the way you <em>think</em> of an idea.</p>
<p>Drawings become your friend: with them, you're not bound to write any portion that is uninspired or follow any order. Berni finds that they help communicate the relationships between ideas.</p>
<p>You reach a full expression of a though faster with diagram than paragraphs.</p>
<p>Once you've mapped your concept into two dimensions, you'll have an easier time describing it in text.</p>
<h2 id="modular-storytelling">Modular Storytelling</h2>
<p>Since we had been talking about documentation, Berni introduced me to the idea of <a href="https://www.duarte.com/slidedocs/">SlideDocs</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Instead of traditional documents, the medium is slides; Instead of a presentation, they are used as reference material.</p>
<p>There are a few aspects of SlideDocs that strike me as valuable. First, I like how each slide covers only one concept. This is helpful both in the construction and consumption of the deck. The slide is organized into a format of increasing levels of depth: the title contains the core idea, diagrams another layer, and small print provides full information. Then, concepts can be interchanged within the deck in a modular fashion.</p>
<p>The second thing that I really like about slide decks is that the format easily flows into a narrative. Since it relies on the more familiar form factor of a presentation, the writer is more likely to tell a story. Though ultimately, everything gets read, the creator is more likely to "speak" to the reader.</p>
<p>Even if you're not writing documentation, there's valuable lessons to gleam from their model. If you organize ideas into bite-sizes units, writing becomes an exercise of arrangement and filling in the details (see slide 44 onward). Further, writing becomes easier if you realize that you are not writing in a vacuum, but communicating to <em>somebody</em>, down the line.</p>
