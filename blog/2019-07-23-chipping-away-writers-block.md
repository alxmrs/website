I had a conversation the other day with my project manager, [Berni Seefeld](https://github.com/seefeldb), about 
strategies to combat writers block. At the time, I had been taking longer than I would like to writing documentation. 
I asked him how he deals with writers block, and he gave me some great advice, which I though was worthy of sharing.
