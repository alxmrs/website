# Your Resume as an Introduction to Version Control and CI/CD 

## Background

You know how to program. Maybe you've taken lower division, perhaps upperdivsion, computer science classes. Or, you've 
attented a boot camp, are self-taught (good for you!), etc. 

However, there are a few known unknowns that separates where you are now to the developer in industry that you hope to 
be. 

In this article, I want to talk about one of these areas: Project Hygine!

I'll cover a few concepts that you've likely heard of but might not use to the fullest extent: Version Control Systems
(VCS) and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).  

I'll be going over a lot of particulars when I could be talking about generalities. I do this because I realize that 
at your current stage, it is critical to have something to show for what you know. Often when starting out, people get 
overwhelmed by information. Instead, I want to leave you knowing enough concepts and specific skills to empower you in 
your own personal projects. 

Instead of talking about these topics with a toy coding problem, I'd like to leave you with something practical. So, 
by the end of this tutorial, you will have a new way to write, maintain, and publish your resume! I love this 
application, because it clearly illustrates the value of VCS and CI/CD. 

Let's begin!
