<p>It's the best advice for creativity I have yet received.</p>
<p>I was a bit lost when I first heard it, having just quit my job about
to go travel for who-knew-how-long. I thought I might use my time off to
figure out new ways to be creative. Before I left, I had a phone call
with a close friend of mine <a
href="/https://www.instagram.com/wyrm.rilye/">who is a musician</a>.
Man, I love Zach.</p>

<p>When I told him my intentions, without missing a beat, he told me to
collect things. I wondered, "what kinds of things?"</p>
<p>Zach told me he took pictures of things he found beautiful,
downloaded bits of the internet on to his phone, and my favorite: he
would write down phrases or words that didn't mean anything but that he
thought sounded cool. These would often become lyrics in his songs. The
category didn't matter so much. The important part was to collect.</p>

<p>"Oh, I get it. But, don't you have to have something you're working
on to know what to collect?" I asked, trying to understand.</p>
<p>(To the best of my memory) Zach replied: "You don't do this to
produce something. You do it for the pleasure of having your collection.
That's it." So much of the process behind art boils down to
decision-making, he posited. Therefore, it's really important to
understand your own sense of taste. What from the world around you fits
into that palate?</p>

<p>I told Zach then how much my process involved thinking top-down. For
the few works of fiction that I had been noodling on at the time, I
started at high levels of abstraction and worked my way down to the
concrete and specific. I told him that his approach was as alien to me
as it was exhilarating. I loved how much of the music and visual art
that Zach makes comes from phenomena that he has observed and admired. I
loved the challenge for me to pay attention to the world around me, to
look beyond myself and within myself at the same time. And I love the
mystery behind the idea of works of art that come primarily from outside
my own mind, that are born out of happenstance and discernment ‚Äì isn't
this what Jung's synchronicity is about, at some level?</p>

<p>We said goodbye after talking for a while. He was living in LA and I
was about to fly off to Australia. I left for fifteen months. By now, at
least as of writing, I've added bits from the whole world to my
collection. Boy, what a pleasure it has been! And, more than anything, I
can't wait to pay Zach a visit and show it to him.</p>
