<h1 id="Ô∏è-how-to-cut-your-wifes-hair-and-stay-married">üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to cut your
wife's hair (and stay married)</h1>
<p><em>December 13, 2022</em></p>
<p>Step 1: Have a wife who may not have any chill but who thinks that
not going to the salon is punk rock.</p>
<p><em>December 14, 2022</em></p>
<p>Today was my first haircut attempt. I looked up a quick youtube video
on how to cut women's hair and this is what popped up:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBZ4ZMVtXIA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2 id="Ô∏è">ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
<p>It's amazing how much and little I know about hair at the same time.
Like, it's quite patronizing that this guy had to explain split ends to
me (currently, my hair is about twice as long as my wife's ‚Äî so I
wouldn't call this concept new to me or something that only women
experience). At the same time, I find myself completely dumbfounded
about the process of combing before cutting, let alone the idea of
feathering. Like, I've had many haircuts ‚Äî including cuts with long hair
that were feathered ‚Äî but being behind the pair of scissors somehow
feels brand new.</p>
<p>I do what the video says and trim Camille's french bob. I took off
too small an amount, so we need to follow up later in the week to get
the length right. I'm not going anywhere near her bangs until I'm much
more practiced ‚Äî that's a grenade that I'll let her handle herself.</p>
<p>I notice that the strand-to-strand lengths are uneven, though the
macro level hair length is about right. I'm stressed to tell Camille
this, but she's really cool about it. She likes how her hair is
feathered and notices that her hair needs to be shorter. Camille reminds
me that she's totally ok with having bad haircuts for a while so that I
can get better. This is not convincing to me at all, but I'll stay along
for the ride.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I used too dull a pair of scissors. I didn't have
clean cuts, and some strands were longer than the rest of the pull of
hair. And, what is the comb in my hand for anyway? It seems useless, and
I don't use it to get a consistent length (it was useful for
straightening her hair initially as well as making a center part).</p>
<p>Camille was satisfied for the most part, given this was my very first
go. Besides the length being too long (kind of the goal, so I could get
more practice): I didn't cut the small hairs underneath the long ones,
especially at the back of her neck. This is not what she was going for,
which was more of a French bob. What I had left her with was somewhat of
a stacked bob, a haircut she noted is associated with Karens.</p>

alt="Not what we&#39;re going for" /></p>
<p>I noted the gravity of my mistake, and set the intention to fix this
the next trim over the weekend.</p>
<p><em>December 18, 2022</em></p>
<p>I had supervision from Camille's mom, Crystal. Her experience is in
men's cuts ‚Äì primarily Jay's, Camille's dad. Any experience is better
than my one haircut and youtube video viewing. Plus, I generally value
her attention to detail over my own.</p>
<p>This time, Camille took a shower before the haircut. I notice that
her hair was way longer than it was last time, even with the cut.
Camille notes that hair will typically lay flatter when wet and that
she's always had wet hair when she's gotten professional cuts. I'll
definitely require this precondition for all haircuts going forward.</p>
<p>After splitting a part and combing Cam's hair, I measured a length to
be cut and presented it for review to Crystal. It looked good, and I
made a first cut. I was then about to feather Cam's hair when Crystal
noted that it is easier to cut all the hair the same length, and feather
last. This would lead to a more even cut, she posited ‚Äî this is what she
did for Jay's hair anyway.</p>
<p>I tried this new approach, and boy was it better. I ended up grabbing
a bit of the cut strand and a bit of the uncut strand, to make sure the
length was even. This gave me more confidence that I had an even cut
throughout. Whereas last time, I did the left side of the front, then
the right front, before wrapping around to the back, this time I went
all the way around Cam's head. Lo and behold, the hair in the front on
the left and right of Cam's part was even! That was a huge relief!</p>
<p>I will admit, this time around, I feel like the back of her head is
shorter than her sides and front. Though, it's hard to tell if my
mistake was from this time, from the last, or if there is no problem at
all and this is how the cut is supposed to be. Next cut, I'll definitely
take the time to look out for the shape of the overall cut as I make
progress towards one side.</p>
<p>I did make a concerted effort to cut the under-hairs at the back of
her neck to be shorter than the overall length. I cut these smaller
hairs by look as opposed to comparing lengths to the front hairs.
Camille tells me that professionals will shave these hairs down, if not
cut them as short as possible with scissors. This bob will be French if
I can help it!</p>
<hr />
<p>Later on in the evening, after her hair was dry and we celebrated a
successful cut, Cam found a patch of smaller hairs near the back of her
neck that were longer than her bob. I had given my wife a rat tail.

<p>We'll fix it tomorrow...</p>
<p><em>February 2023</em></p>
<p>I didn't take immediately after this cut. Here's what I remember
about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her hair was wet at the beginning, which helped.</li>
<li>I cut it fast.</li>
<li>It was cut short.</li>
<li>Too short.</li>
</ul>
<p>Her haircut was so short that we waited three months until her next
haircut.</p>

<p><em>Her hair falls above her chin, not just below it!</em></p>
<p><em>May 20, 2023</em></p>
<p>Ok. I'm graduating to using the straight razor. It's time to get
serious. Luckily, Cam found a professional video on the subject <a
href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/385045">for me to rent</a>.</p>
<p>This was quite a good tutorial on giving French bobs. I like the hair
dressers music choices. Some of the ideas from the video that stuck with
me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to layer the back of the head just as you layer the sides
and front!</li>
<li>‚ÄúNeck Bang‚Äù ‚Äî the specific way you layer the back of the head, where
you cut the undermost, bottommost layer first. It can be especially
short, because other layers will fall atop of it, not only to prevent a
Karen look, but to give the bob true curve and texture.</li>
<li>It may have not been the intention of the video, but I so
appreciated watching (and mimicking) the general ‚Äúcomb and fold
technique.‚Äù It was so helpful to see examples (and hear instructions) on
how to manage layers of hair: starting with the back (‚Äùneck bangs‚Äù),
moving to the sides behind the ears, then the sides, then all the way to
the front.</li>
<li>I like the creator's recommendation for splitting around the ears,
specifically. She provides a useful example for knowing which hairs
should fall to the front and back of the ear.</li>
<li>I get a good set of instructions for how to look for a length and
make it consistent. In all my initial cuts, I really just hoped that it
was somewhat close to even length and understood that I will probably
have to correct it. Now, I feel like I don't have to do this
anymore.</li>
<li>Last, and most important, I really value this video's lessons in how
to cut with a straight razor. You really just can't beat seeing examples
of cuts. And while I can't be in the room to receive the lesson, this is
the next best thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>My initial cut following this video, I just focused on getting the
length and end texture right. I didn't attempt to cut to get the weight
or density right, since I have a feathered razor (she said that it's
really easy to take off too much weight with those).</p>
<p>So, I made a first pass, where I cut off the minimum amount possible
using proper razor technique. I didn't want to cut too much off like I
did in February! I was a bit too cautious, and it ended up too long. I
repeated the cut the next day, again cutting off the smallest amount
possible. This ended up being the right length! Now, Cam could look good
going to her office happy hour. If anything, I appreciated getting to do
the cut twice. It was good practice and it helped build confidence with
the razor.</p>

<p><em>June 10, 2023</em></p>
<p>The length was still good. Now, Cam wants me to try to take away some
weight so it looks more like a true bob. Since it was my first serious
attempt to cut for weight, I re-watched parts of the Vimeo tutorial, and
cut very conservatively. Cam was freaked when she saw how much hair fell
to the ground! But, it was clear that after the cut, I didn't really
take off that much at all.</p>
