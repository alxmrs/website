<h1 class="title">How I backed up all my wedding footage in the

<p>My wife and I absolutely love our <a
href="/https://amariproductions.com/camille-alex/">wedding video</a>. I
honestly can‚Äôt imagine how it could have been any better. In addition to
their excellent work, we chose <a
href="/https://amariproductions.com/">Amari Productions</a> as our
videographers because they offered us the ability to get all our wedding
footage in raw. This really appealed to us since we think it would make
a really great anniversary present down the line to eventually produce a
longer wedding movie. This presents us a problem ‚Äî how do we download
and store all this video?</p>
<p>We face an immediate problem: Amari has sent us a Google Drive folder
with the 100 or so gigabytes of raw files (zipped) that will be deleted
in about a few weeks. My wife and I are not at home at the moment, so
it‚Äôs a bit impractical for us to download all of this to a terabyte hard
drive.</p>
<aside>

<p>üí° Aside: Apparently, hard drives <a
href="/https://datarecovery.com/rd/ssd-lifespans-how-long-can-you-trust-your-solid-state-drive">expire</a>.
This doesn‚Äôt bode well if we want to keep something so precious
indefinitely.</p>
</aside>

<p>A remote backup is definitely the right move. However, I am not quite
ready yet to <a href="/https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html">pay
for that much Google Drive space</a> every year. Can I do better with
Google Cloud Storage?</p>
<p>Ideally, I want to solve for both 1) convenient data transfer and 2)
cheap long-term storage.</p>
<h1 id="whats-this-going-to-cost">What‚Äôs this going to cost?</h1>
<p>My approach was to set up a Google Cloud Storage bucket as cheaply as
possible. (For the non-technical reader: A bucket is like a folder in
Drive.) I‚Äôve estimating that it would cost me about $14 in the first
year, given that I need to transfer the data and I‚Äôll probably want to
download it once. This is cheap enough that I don‚Äôt really care to
estimate the exact annual cost thereafter, which will almost certainly
be lower (maybe $7 a year).</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt expect to access the data that often, so the archival storage
class seems good enough for me. I feel pretty confident about GCP‚Äôs lack
of data loss, so I only chose to host the data in a single data
center.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-back-it-all-up">How did I back it all up?</h2>
<p>I basically followed <a
href="/https://philipplies.medium.com/transferring-data-from-google-drive-to-google-cloud-storage-using-google-colab-96e088a8c041">this
article</a> ‚Äôs approach for copying data between Google Drive and Google
Cloud Storage. The steps for me looked like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I ‚ÄúAdded a Shortcut‚Äù from Amari‚Äôs shared folder to my personal
drive. This was essential for the it to show up in my mounted drive
later on.</li>
<li>I created a cloud bucket that suited my needs. I called it
<code>gs://merose-wedding-video-raw</code>. I typically use long,
verbose names like these since bucket names have to be globally
unique.</li>
<li>I created a new Colab notebook and followed the steps mentioned in
the article. After the setup, the actual transfer more or less amounted
to a <code>gsutil</code> invocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here‚Äôs the actual Colab that I used to make the transfer, if you‚Äôd
like to do something similar yourself (remember to change the Drive
folder name and destination bucket).</p>

Colaboratory</a></p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>I think I‚Äôve met all my goals to have a convenient, cheap backup of
my wedding videos. This whole process was incredibly easy: With Colab, I
didn‚Äôt have to install or set anything up. Writing this article probably
took ten times as long as it did to write the code. My favorite part:
this basically amounts to renting a hard drive from Google, where
they‚Äôre on the hook for maintenance.</p>
