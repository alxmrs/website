<p>Notes from the <em>Community Emergency Response Team</em> Program</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Safety</li>
<li>Disaster medical</li>
<li>Light search &amp; rescue</li>
<li>CERT organization</li>
<li>Disaster psych
<ul>
<li>Nobody gets through this unscathed. How do we take care of ourselves
and each other?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CERT and terrorism
<ul>
<li>Basically, we don't deal with terrorist events. Outside of scope;
leave it to the pros.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unit-1-hazards">Unit 1: Hazards</h2>
<p>Objectives</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles</li>
<li>types of hazards</li>
<li>Undertake actions</li>
<li>functions of CERT
<ul>
<li>CERT has two different options: First, a responsibility to take care
of ourselves, families, and neighbors. Second, how can we help the
broader community?</li>
<li>We may never get deployed to help the community. But, everything
learned here can be used to support oneself, family, neighborhood.</li>
<li>This is not the end all be-all. Continued training, refreshers,
radio, CPR, First Aid is encouraged. If you don't use it, you lose it.
Hard to remember everything.
<ul>
<li>This is more of an intro to disaster preparedness</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>stop the bleed class</em>: will be offered in the future (here),
sometime in the spring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to be prepared to mitigate/lesson impacts of disasters</li>
<li>All community members should take steps to prepare</li>
<li>Best when it is specific to idiosyncrasies of the community in
question.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Central coast doesn't need to prepare for tornadoes.</li>
<li>We need to prepare for earthquakes --&gt; power outages | fires |
blocked roads | food insecurity | power scarcity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Government</p>
<ul>
<li>gov't has responsibility to
<ul>
<li>dev test refine emergency plans</li>
<li>ensure responders are sufficiently equipped and skilled</li>
<li>services to protect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we are a small community, small gov't. so, we need to get by without
public services. thus, we need to be prepared.
<ul>
<li>Q: are services proportional to the population?</li>
<li>A: Yes, in the state of CA, more or less. In SBC, we're overstaffed
based on the table (2 ambulances, have 50 deputies) on paper
<ul>
<li>We are grossly understaffed due to turnover; wedged between a lot of
affluent regions (hard to recruit) with relatively small footprints</li>
<li>Distinction btw population vs land size. SBC is the state of RI in
land size, but the pop is more modest. lot of ground to cover.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Emergency Operations Plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigns resp to organizations and indiv (who does what)
<ul>
<li>in 2017, both fire and sheriffs where in charge, leading to a
pissing contest. Two diff command posts, didn't talk to each other,
wasn't effective.</li>
<li>Clear comms needed, as well as disjoint responsibilities, and a
clear chain of command.</li>
<li>Law enf is default responsible for evacuation. however, fire is in
charge of water rescue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Community leaders</p>
<ul>
<li>Elected personelle who have a responsibility to prepare community
<ul>
<li>participate on local planning councils</li>
<li>id and integrate resources into plans</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in 2017 floods, the shelter location was a place that wasn't
accepting animals; people won;t go there</li>
</ul>
<p>The Public</p>
<ul>
<li>Community alerts
<ul>
<li>SBC alerts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take training</li>
<li>Practice skills and personal plans</li>
<li>Networking, help others</li>
<li>Give feedback to community</li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise: Crash landing on the moon</p>
<ul>
<li>Situational awareness</li>
<li>Sizeup
<ul>
<li>Gather facts</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Types of disaster</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural</li>
<li>Technological</li>
<li>Intentional</li>
</ul>
<p>Key disaster elements</p>
<ul>
<li>No warning / unexpected
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, we do have an idea if there will be a disaster.
<ul>
<li>severe weather --&gt; evac warnings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are redundant systems (alerts, social media, etc.). But, it is
also upon you to have backup systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emergency personnel may be overwhelmed</li>
<li>Lives, health, and the environment are endangered</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Police, Fire, etc. aren't coming. You don't know. Should you go
or should you stay? How do you know?</em></p>
<p><em>Amateur Radio</em> is always the last form of communication for
disasters. GMRS Radios. Can purchase from box stores. See exam / club -
SBC has a club! May 3 you can get licensed! Radio can transmit messages
to cell phones far away! License is good for 10 years and covers your
entire family! Q: What do people do in a radio club? A: Meet once a
week, test phones / talk, set up repeaters, have better coverage than
cell phones!</p>
<p>Our dispatch center is still in SC. Call 911, it goes there, then
gets dispatched to local resources.</p>
<p>Firstnet? iPhone 14+ will switch to a satphone when cell goes
out!</p>
<p>Local Hazard Vulnerability</p>
<ul>
<li>Id most common disasters that occur</li>
<li>Id possible hazards with most severe impact</li>
<li>consider recent or historical impacts</li>
<li><em>Make sure your car isn't below half a tank!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What's the difference between an evauation order vs warning?</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning: you should go, please get you</li>
<li>Order: you needed to have been gone yesterday</li>
<li><em>Don't wait around for an evautaion order, leave at a
warning!</em></li>
<li>If you chose to ignore an order, there will be no emergency
response</li>
</ul>
<p>Dmg to infra</p>
<ul>
<li>Police are working on grave public safety stuff</li>
<li>FF suppressing major fires</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a law to offer mutual aid in disasters Q: How are needs
communicated in a response? A: Admin team works on this; contact {moab}?
other networks and ask for resources. CA has lots of such networks; goes
to a state level, goes to local region w/in state, then goes to partners
btw states.</p>
<p>Hazards related to structure type</p>
<ul>
<li>may not be able to select type of structure when a disaster
occurs</li>
<li>eng'd buildings have performed well in most types of disasters</li>
<li>in SBC, unrefnforced masonry, chimeneys, etc. were major hazards.
Newer buildings are reinforced and are very safe.
<ul>
<li>If possible, try to be in a building with sprinklers, that is
reinforced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need to know your escape routes for <em>you</em>.
<ul>
<li>How many exists does Nob Hill have? Safeway? Target? Where are they?
Have you ever looked for an exit besides the front door?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Hazards from Homes</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas line ruptures -- know how to shut off propane tanks</li>
<li>How do you shut off circuit breakers?
<ul>
<li>Electric shock potential? e.g. fridge, faulty wiring</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing for a disaster</p>
<ul>
<li>Know specific needs for yourself and your family.</li>
<li>The website has multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation plan.
<ul>
<li>Data updated every three years!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Protective actions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is really going on?
<ul>
<li>Is there gas actually leaking? Diff between what you prepared for vs
what is actually happening</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can we stay where we are, or do we need to leave?</li>
<li>Are there things we need to do to protect airways and breathing?
<ul>
<li>Do we need to cover windows cause the air is so bad?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do we have masks in the house to protect us from breathing chemicals
in the air?</li>
<li>How to rm contaminants from your home</li>
<li>Practice good hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sheltering</p>
<ul>
<li>in place: sealing a room</li>
<li>shelter for an extended time</li>
<li>mass care or community shelter</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev disaster plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a plan for where you'll meet family? Do you know how
you'll get there?</li>
<li>Who is your out-of-state check in contact?</li>
<li>How can you escape your home? Doors? Windows?</li>
<li>What's the safest place at work, school, church? What's the least
safe?</li>
<li>What routes can you use to escape your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Are you able to pick up your kids --&gt; when <em>everyone</em> is
doing the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Prep for disater</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you get your family out of your home and your go bag in 4
minutes
<ul>
<li>have in your car, at home, and at work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want to lesson the impact.
<ul>
<li>There's a small fire, and you can put it out. You have mitigated
that disaster.</li>
<li>If you have sufficient insurace, you can mitigate the disaster.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Things we can do in advance</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchor heavy furniture</li>
<li>brace bookcases to the wall</li>
<li>storm sutters?</li>
<li>childproof cabinet doors --&gt; even w/o little kids! big earthquake
prepareness. Child safety locks mitigates the mess!</li>
<li>locate and label gas, electricity, and water in your house to know
how to shut it off.
<ul>
<li>If you need a special tool: where is it? can you find it?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other mitigation measures</p>
<ul>
<li>Bold houses to foundation</li>
<li>Propane tanks and chimneys need to be secured</li>
<li>can you build a safe room? Can you hold up there for a while? What
can you do in a pinch?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortify your home</p>
<ul>
<li>fortify against home fires, mudslies, etc.</li>
<li>in Aromas, we have eukalyptus trees! so prone to fires! They are
shallow rooted!</li>
</ul>
<p>Get Invovled</p>
<ul>
<li>Req participation for all</li>
<li>Training and practice opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>CERT Disaster response</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond immediately after a fire</li>
<li>Be able to turn off your own utilities</li>
<li>Can you extinguish your own small fires?</li>
<li>Can you take care of injuries as much as possible until you can get
better treatment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal protective equipment</p>
<ul>
<li>Helmet</li>
<li>Goggles</li>
<li>N95 Mask</li>
<li>Gloves (work and non-latex)</li>
<li>Sturdy shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-disaster roles</p>
<ul>
<li>Id and aid neighbors/coworkers who might need assistance
<ul>
<li>Deploy in teams. When we deploy, we don't self-deploy in SBC, we do
when instructed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we get deployed, we wear protective equip</li>
<li>Make a plan, act on the plan, and re-evaluate. Turn over to
professionals when they arive.</li>
<li>Help with community events</li>
<li>Help with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How many CERT-trained people are in SBC? A: ??. Don't really have
a CERT team, but there isn't a cohesive organized org. Want to do things
on a scheduled basis. Goal: have cert team do the basic training and
other trainings. Would love to see a neighborhood watch! Engage with
community, see what they need, see how one can help, etc. CERT vs NERT
(neighborhood) NextDoor would be a good way to impl CERT -- comm
lines.</p>
<p>Aromas borders the three counties. Other counties do CERT training,
this county (SBC) was talking about doing its own CERT team! Want to get
Monterey and SC reps out there, too!</p>
<p>It needs to be both an indiv and team effort.</p>
<p>Q: When there is a call, when and how will it arrive ? A: It will
arrive from us, Anthony + office of emergency services. It's all one big
spider web pyramid structure.</p>
<p>Q: is there something below the CERT? e.g. I live in Santana ranch,
we use next door and text. I could go as part of that committee, have a
neighborhood thing, give them basic lessons A: No, there's not anything
organized at an official level.</p>
<p>CERT provides a legal structure -- insurance, liability, etc. Good
Samaritan law. Adv to being under an authority.</p>
<p>Q: If we get activated, is it on us to get to the location? A:
Yes.</p>
<p>Q: If an emergency did happen here, would you send a msg to all the
CERT team? A: We're not at that level yet. If we had a CERT team, we'd
have a roster, and call people out. CERT is strictly a volunteer org.
Let's say we made a call out, people would meet at the pre-design
staging area. That's the plan to eventually do that.</p>
<p>Protected for disaster workers</p>
<ul>
<li>CERT members are generally protected by good samaritan laws</li>
<li>Don't act outside of your training</li>
<li>Not our job to be law enforcement / stop people</li>
</ul>
<p>Other trainings</p>
<ul>
<li>AED: first thing when you enter a building: where are the AEDs.</li>
<li>Donations mgmt</li>
<li>Volunteers need to be managed, too. Sometimes, people have alterior
motives</li>
<li>You can spend forever on the FEMA websites.</li>
<li>Sometimes, CERT folks will pay for you to go to some of these
classes! e.g. first aid, shelter mgmt, etc.</li>

<h2 id="unit-3-disaster-medical-ops">Unit 3: Disaster Medical Ops</h2>
<p><em>2025-03-08</em></p>
<p>Q: How was CERT involved in the fires in LA, or 911, or Hawaii? A:
Not sure if Hawaii has a CERT program. CERT programs are behind the
scenes, e.g. in the red cross, etc. they don't get a lot of pub, but
they are out there. Every time there is a natural disaster, they are out
there. The people who have the best chance of survival are those who
have done their training.</p>
<p>Airplanes: "Now, I pay attention to the emergency trainings before
takeoff. I visualize what could happen, I pay attention to who is
sitting around me. I think how I could help."</p>
<p>Q: Does this stress you out? A: There is a difference btw worry and
preparation. Preparation is coming up with a response, not a reaction. I
find that when I have situational awareness, I am more prepared to
respond. When i don't know and I get into a rabbit hole of what I can't
control, I tend to worry. Prepping makes me feel more relaxed.</p>
<p>Anthony: Training can help you feel more relaxed. If you've seen it
before a billion times, what's a billion in one?</p>
<p>"I hate being dependent on other people."</p>
<p>"I once came from a worry standpoint. Then I got this job and did a
lot of public safety training. I took it seriously and learned a lot.
Tragedy of the station fire. Shortly after that training, I went to a
show at the Catalyst in SC. I started to feel that feeling of what I
knew could go wrong. But I did what you did, I started talking myself
out of it. I planned where I would go out in the show if something went
wrong. I transitioned from worrying to having tools to alleviating
feer"</p>
<p>Anthony: It starts with situational awareness. For anything, you have
to be aware. A lot of us sleepwalk through life (phones, emails, etc.).
It helps with terrorism, natural disasters, etc. Once you do that,
you'll open your eyes up, and then you'll be able to start
preparing.</p>
<p>"Why do cops sit at the back wall in public places? Do you think they
know where the exists are?"</p>
<p>There is an active shooting drill next week! People tend to be
reactionary. There are higher enrollments in this class in reaction to
recent fires (e.g. Moss Landing).</p>
<p>"I almost got run off the road the other day."</p>
<p>"Developing situational awareness takes practice. It's a muscle that
we strengthen."</p>
<p>"I used to have a dinner with my buddies to talk about preparedness.
Have a preparedness night!" --&gt; Disaster Dinner!</p>
<hr />
<p>Disaster Med Ops - Part 1</p>
<p>Going to talk about the major causes of death. This is bc we want to
do the most good for the most people. This practically means, we want to
try to keep em alive a little longer.</p>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of victims could exceed the capacity for treatment
locally</li>
<li>Survivors need to assist each other
<ul>
<li>They'll do what they know how to do</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q: Where is the nearest trauma center?
<ul>
<li>Salinas
<ul>
<li>This is, if you're lucky, a 25 min drive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or San Jose!</li>
<li>You can be overwhelmed immediately. Mass causality incident.
<ul>
<li>Imagine a bus.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Importance of Quick Action</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Death within minutes, severe trauma</li>
<li>Phase 2: several hours</li>

<p>You have to practice! Has anyone dealt with anyone bleeding out? No?
Then the first time is going to be hard.</p>
<p>Three "Killers"</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency medicine "killers"
<ul>
<li>Airway obstr</li>
<li>Bleeding</li>
<li>Shock</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1st priority of medical ops
<ul>
<li>Open airway -- nothing else matters if they can't breathe</li>
<li>Control bleeding</li>
<li>Treat shock</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>How to approach a victim</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure victim can see you</li>
<li>ID yourself
<ul>
<li>name and organization (e.g. CERT)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Request permission to treat, if possible
<ul>
<li>if unconscious, premission is assumed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Respect cultural differences</li>
</ul>
<p>Head-tilt / chin-lift method.</p>
<ul>
<li>one hand on forehead</li>
<li>another hand on jaw</li>
<li>When ppl are conscious, there is muscle rigidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of Bleeding - 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Arterial bleeding
<ul>
<li>spurting with the heart beat</li>
<li>only have a couple minutes to address</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Venous bleeding
<ul>
<li>Slower, lower pressure</li>
<li>as blood returns back to the heart</li>
<li>Oozing, still significant</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Capillary bleeding
<ul>
<li>Normal abraison and cuts</li>
<li>unluckly to die</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Control Bleeding</p>
<ul>
<li>3 main methods
<ul>
<li>Direct pressure</li>
<li>Elevation</li>
<li>Pressure points
<ul>
<li>e.g. squish arteries to the bone</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Firm direct pressure is very effective</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure Points</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm
<ul>
<li>just above the elbow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Femoral pressure point
<ul>
<li>above the upper thigh</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Popliteal pressure point
<ul>
<li>behind the knee</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Will at least slow down the bleeding</li>
</ul>
<p>Shock</p>
<ul>
<li>Results of ineffective circulation of the blood</li>
<li>Shock --&gt; death of
<ul>
<li>cells</li>
<li>tissues</li>
<li>organs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing Shock</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid ans hallow breathing</li>
<li>Capillary refill of greater than 2 seconds
<ul>
<li>check finger tips, pinch fingers</li>
<li>Also, "profusion"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Failure to follow simple cmds, such as "squeeze my hand"</li>
<li>Symptoms of shock are easily missed! Pay careful attention to your
patient!</li>
<li>Treat shock by having a person lay down, elevate feet, cover w/
blanket</li>
</ul>

<p>What is Triage?</p>
<ul>
<li>Process for mgmt of mass casualty events
<ul>
<li>Victims are evaluated</li>
<li>victims are sorted by urgency of need</li>
<li>victims are set up for immediate or delayed treatment</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Triage</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate (I): life threatening: airway, blooding, shock</li>
<li>Delayed (D): do not jeopardize victims life, treatment can be
delayed</li>
<li>Minor (M): walking wounded and generally ambulatory (able to
walk)</li>
<li>Dead (DEAD): No respiration after two attempts to open airway
<ul>
<li>Really hard for a lot of us</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Rescuer Safety During Triage</p>
<ul>
<li>If hazmat or terrorist event is suspect, CERT members DO NOT respond
<ul>
<li>Evacuate as safely as possible</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ALWAYS wear PPE
<ul>
<li>helmet</li>
<li>goggles</li>
<li>N95</li>
<li>work gloves</li>
<li>sturdy shoes or boots</li>
<li>non-latex exam gloves</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Triage process</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stop look listen and think (respond, don't react)</li>
<li>Conduct voice triage
<ol type="1">
<li>are you ok? can you hear me? my name is alex, how can I help you?
Can you come out? can you squeeze my hand?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Start where you stand, follow a systematic route
<ol type="1">
<li>this is a major event. school-bus vs train. lots of injured people
across a debris field.</li>
<li>don't skip around, you'll likely miss someone</li>
</ol></li>
<li>evaluate each victim and tag</li>
<li>treat I victims immediately</li>
<li>Document triage results</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4: Triage evaluation</p>
<ul>
<li>Check airway and breathing</li>
<li>Check circulation and bleeding</li>
<li>Check mental status</li>
</ul>
<p>Triage pitfalls</p>
<ul>
<li>No team plan, organization or goal</li>
<li>Indecisive leadership</li>
<li>Too much focus on one injury</li>
<li>Treatment (rather than triage) performed</li>
</ul>
<p>Unit summary</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to

<li>ID the three killers</li>
<li>apply techniques for opening the airway, control bleeding, and treat
shock</li>
<li>Conduct triage under simulated disaster conditions</li>

<p>Have a plan beforehand. We're saving more lives than we ever did
before bc we are more organized.</p>

Ops - Part 2</h2>
<p><em>Video: unit 3 review</em> (notes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Can decontaminate gloves by dipping in bleach mixture (1:10 bleach
to water). It can clean gloves so long as it still smells like
bleach.</li>
<li>Shock in children: blanch test / capillary refresh test is NOT VALID
in children! Only mental status counts for children!</li>
<li>When working in pairs, it's helpful to have an actor and a
documenter. There are advantages for people working in pairs. Good to
hold each other accountable.
<ul>
<li>Good to always stay together as a unit. May be surprising --
usually, the instinct is to split up.</li>
<li>Even, three is often preferred. e.g. one person could be a driver --
they just drive. person 2 -- navigating, looking for hazards, person 3
-- scribe, documenting.
<ul>
<li>The more you have documented, the better is is for everyone!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are legal ramifications for declaring that you are with CERT.
It is a national organization. It's best to be activated by CERT
officially rather than to volunteer that info.</p>
<p>Gilory Garlic festival shooting</p>
<ul>
<li>CERT volunteer helped ppl with mobility issues get around in the
conference</li>
<li>When the shooting happened, the CERT people that were already there
helped transport people away / to safety.</li>
<li>They happened to already be there, and they were able to step into

<ul>
<li>Triage</li>
<li>Treatment</li>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Morgue</li>
<li>Supply
<ul>
<li>In SBC, when the roads are impacted in a major event (e.g. floods),
not only can't people not get out, but we can't get stuff in!
<ul>
<li>e.g. supplies, ambulances, hospital staff, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Establish a medical treatment area</p>
<ul>
<li>Select site and set up treatment area as soon as injured survivors
are confirmed</li>
<li>When determining best location(s) for treatment area, consider:
<ul>
<li>safety of rescuers and survivors</li>
<li>most effective use of resources</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Q: If ambulances aren't coming, do we transport ppl to hospitals in
our own vehicles? A: Probably? If it's a huge mass casualty event, then
that makes sense. Getting more help takes time. So, this is a good thing
to do. There will be a lot of self-transportation. There is liability
implied. However, it's important when the situation is serious. Up to
individuals to make their own decision.</p>
<p>Treatment area site selection</p>
<ul>
<li>Site selected should be
<ul>
<li>In safe area, free of debris and hazards</li>
<li>Upwind, uphill, upstream of hazard zones
<ul>
<li>Think: battery plant fire. What way is the wind blowing?</li>
<li>Wind typically blows from the west to the east (correolis
effect!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>accessible by transportation vehicles</li>
<li>Expandable
<ul>
<li>always make your area bigger than you need. It's easier to shrink it
down that it is to make it bigger.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>One of SBC's treatment areas would be the high school
<ul>
<li>large space</li>
<li>can set up different areas</li>
<li>can land a helicopter there</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another area would be Belato park</li>
</ul>
<p>Deployed CERT personnel have coverage. We are not legally required to
provide aid. Individuals have to make an informed decision for yourself.

<p>Head to toe assesment ...</p>
<p>Q: Photos as documentation? A: iffy. As a private citizen, you can do
that, but it's not sanctioned by CERT use discretion. e.g. take pictures

<li>building off foundation</li>
<li>DO NOT ENTER A BUILDING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!</li>
</ul>
<p>Crimes of opportunity happen during disasters. e.g. palisade fires,
people tried sneaking into places to steal things -- one person posed as

<p>Assessing and communicating dmg</p>
<ul>

<li>CERTs and Terrorist Incidents</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: Where would you store your cool backpack? A: By your front door,
say a closet. Or if you commute a lot (or in a single vehicle) then, in
your car. If e.g. a bedroom is a saferoom, then you might keep disaster
preparedness stuff in that saferoom. Hack: During earthquakes, things
get rearranged. Power tends to go out. Scenario: night, dark, no power,
things rearanged, broken glass --&gt; how do you protect your feet?
Lifehack: take older shoes or slippers, ziptie them to your bedframe
where you're getting out of bed. Then, you'll be able to find your shoes
and protect your feet.</p>
<p>What is terrorism?</p>
<ul>
<li>"Unlawful use for force/violence against person or property to
intimidate/corece a gov't, civil pop, etc. in furtherance of political
or social objectives."</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist Goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Mass casualties</li>
<li>loss of critical resources</li>
<li>disrupt vital services (e.g. comms)</li>
<li>disrupt economy</li>
<li>heighten fear</li>
</ul>
<p>Terror Targets</p>
<ul>
<li>Seats of gov't</li>
<li>Key industries</li>
<li>bridges, subways, key transportation fascilities</li>
<li>Water supplies &amp; utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: What are targets here? A: roads, utilities, etc.</p>
<p>Drones: They're illegal in stadiums, but not nece a threat. Have to
look at the drone and see if it is a threat. Does it carry leaflets?
(with threats?) White powder? Would any powder cause a stampede?</p>
<p>Terror threat nearby: cut the comm lines, and shot the hell out of a
power station trying to take it down. It's not been shared a lot because
it's vulnerable and we don't want copy cats.</p>
<p>2 types of terrorism: 1) 9/11, sure. 2) domestic -- we have a
<em>large</em> amount of this one! We even have a lot of one in
<em>this</em> county, and nearby counties. There are alerts to different
agencies that with the new prez, there will be more activity. A lot of
these groups blend in on the streets. It is on the rise and projected to
grow over the next few years.</p>
<p>SF: Security guard chases a homeless person on an e-bike, hits two
pedestrians, the e-bike gets away. Later, the sec guard shows up to his
shift later (after laying low). He then performs suicide-by-cop (pulls a
weapon on a cop), and the cops get him. This is scary, but not
terrorism.</p>
<p>Situational awareness is key. Trust your spidy sense.</p>
<p>SBC: Targets include critical infra (water) and comms</p>
<p>Terrorist Weapons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Chem</li>
<li>Bio</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>Chemical Weapons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>blister agents</li>
<li>blood agents</li>
<li>choking agents</li>
<li>nerve agents</li>
<li>riot-control agents</li>
</ol>
<p>If youre ever in a situation where a riot-control agent is applied,
it sucks but you will be fine. It feels like you will die, but you
won't.</p>
<p>Bio Weapons Routes of exposure: Inhalation, Ingestion, Absorption If
they're applied to you, then "that's a wrap." Q: How would you recognize
them? A: There's a lot of dead people or animals. e.g. birds and fish in
the water ways.</p>
<p>Situational awareness: If these are present --&gt; uphill, upwind,
upstream.</p>
<p>Bioweapons are often odorless, colorless, hard to detect.</p>
<p>Radiological Weapons</p>
<ul>
<li>Considered a higher threat because components are easy to
obtain</li>
<li>Don't need to buy these --&gt; could go to, say, hospitals to get
the agents.</li>
<li>There are detectors for radioactive material in highways and
stadiums, often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nuclear Weapons</p>
<ul>
<li>Force from nuke reaction</li>
<li>Affected area is larger as contaminated obj spreads</li>
<li>Casualties beyond initial attack</li>
<li>Long-term effects difficult to monitor and track</li>
</ul>
<p>High Yield Explosives</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapon of choices for terrorists
<ul>
<li>Used in 80% of attacks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Military munitions (grenades, mortars, missiles)</li>
<li>Newer explosives called improvised explosive devices or IEDs</li>
<li>What brought down OK city fed building? Ammonium Nitrate from
<em>fertilizer</em>.</li>
<li>A lot of stuff gets stolen!</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the world, the go-to IED across the world is v-bids (vehicle
borne ...). It's a very effective tools, big ROI. Has a large radius and
instills fear. Now terrorists are starting to change their playbook.
There is less "shoot up a place" and more "drive a truck here and blow
it up."</p>
<p>Assessing the Risk</p>

in people's homes when it was occupied. This cause a lot of trauma for
ppl who lived in the neighborhoods. There were ppl in the teacher's CERT
classes who still kept that trauma.</li>
<li>Incident 5 years ago, turning off to Fraisure Lake (sp), the wheel
came off the vehicle and came right after the teacher. Scared shitless.
Took evasive action, moved out of the way.

<p>Q: Can a journal for stress become a legal liability? A: Only if you
get involved in criminal activity.</p>
<p>How you can reduce stress</p>
<ul>
<li>Enough sleep</li>
<li>exercise regularly</li>
<li>eat a balanced diet</li>
<li>balance work/play/rest</li>
<li>allow yourself to receive as well as give (grace)</li>
<li>connect with others</li>
<li>use spiritual resources (family, friends)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take care of yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>trauma can follow a disaster</li>
<li>explain to family members and friends what you need:
<ul>
<li>listen when you want to talk</li>
<li>don't force you to talk</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not ready to talk, don't feel compelled to talk. It can
leak out over time when the time is right.</p>
<p>How Team Leaders Reduce Stress</p>
<ul>
<li>Brief CERT Personnel beforehand</li>
<li>remember CERT is a team</li>
<li>rest and regroup</li>
<li>take breaks away</li>
<li>eat properly, stay hydrated</li>
<li>arrange for debriefing</li>
<li>rotate teams and duties</li>
<li>phase out workers gradually</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mass casualty event, you have to ask yourself if these are
things you can live with. You may have to walk away from someone who
will then die. At the EOD, this is a volunteer thing. You may see the
worst thing you'll see in your entire life. As much as we'd love to have
to you volunteer, you have to reckon this with yourself. The purpose of
CERT is to protect yourself, family, and neighborhood. As such, you're
likely to face horrible things happening to people you know and
love.</p>
<p>Critical incident stress debriefing</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>introductions and descriptions</li>
<li>review factual material</li>
<li>sharing of initial thoughts and feelings</li>
<li>sharing of emotional reactions to incidents</li>
<li>instruction about normal stress reactions</li>
<li>review of symptoms</li>
<li>closing and further needs assessment</li>
</ol>
<p>Phases of Crisis</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact - the event itself</li>
<li>Inventory - self-check</li>
<li>Rescue - selves or others</li>
<li>Recovery - can take hours, days, weeks, months, years</li>
</ul>
<p>Traumatic crisis</p>
<ul>
<li>actual or potential death</li>
<li>serious injury</li>
<li>destruction</li>
<li>loss of contact w/ family or close friends
<ul>
<li>With current addition crisis going on, so many people have loss
touch with close ones bc of addiction.</li>
<li>People don't often talk about trauma related to this bc of the shame
related to addiction.
<ul>
<li>Mental health became more OK to talk about; but addiction, not as
much.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Effects of traumatic stress</p>
<ul>
<li>cognitive functioning</li>
<li>physical health</li>
<li>interpersonal relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>Mediating factors</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior experiences with a similar event</li>
<li>Intensity of disruption</li>
<li>Individual feelings about event</li>
<li>emotional strength of the individual</li>
<li>Len of time since the event</li>
</ul>
<p>Stabilizing Survivors</p>
<ul>
<li>assess survivors for injury or shock</li>
<li>gen uninjured people to help</li>
<li>provide support by
<ul>
<li>listening</li>
<li>empathizing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>help survivors connect with natural support systems</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't help with everyone's load, but I can help people get back in
touch with their support system (or develop one)</p>
<p>How to be an empathetic listener</p>
<ul>
<li>put yourself in your speaker's shoes (get vulnerable)</li>
<li>listen for meaning, not just words</li>
<li>pay attention to nonverbal comms</li>
<li>paraphrase the speaker</li>
</ul>
<p>It's so important to hold space for the other person Ask open-ended
questions. ("ORS"?) Takes lots of practice</p>
<p>Avoid Saying...</p>
<ul>
<li>"I understand"</li>
<li>"Don't feel bad"</li>
<li>"You're strong" or "you'll get through this"</li>
<li>"Don't cry"</li>
<li>"It's god's will"</li>
<li>"It could be worse"</li>
<li>"At least you still have..."</li>
<li>"Everything will be ok"</li>
</ul>
<p>These things can bring a lot of drama.</p>
<p>Managing the Death Scene</p>
<ul>
<li>covert the body; treat it w/ respect</li>
<li>move the body to temp morgue</li>
<li>follow local laws and protocols</li>
<li>talk with local authorities</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't have a lot of experience with death in our culture. People
die in hospitals more than they do at home. People have become more
uncomfortable with talking about it.</p>
<p>Probably not going to be touching any dead bodies... Only under
direction will we be moving people's remains to a temporary morgue</p>
<p>Informing Family + Friends of a Death (highly unlikely)</p>
<ul>
<li>separate the family member(s) or friends</li>
<li>have the person(s) sit down</li>
<li>make eye contact</li>
<li>"I'm sorry, but your family member has died. I am so sorry."</li>
<li>Let the family and friends grieve</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't lie to people!</p>
