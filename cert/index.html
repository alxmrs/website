<p>Notes from the <em>Community Emergency Response Team</em> Program</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Safety</li>
<li>Disaster medical</li>
<li>Light search &amp; rescue</li>
<li>CERT organization</li>
<li>Disaster psych
<ul>
<li>Nobody gets through this unscathed. How do we take care of ourselves
and each other?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CERT and terrorism
<ul>
<li>Basically, we don't deal with terrorist events. Outside of scope;
leave it to the pros.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles</li>
<li>types of hazards</li>
<li>Undertake actions</li>
<li>functions of CERT
<ul>
<li>CERT has two different options: First, a responsibility to take care
of ourselves, families, and neighbors. Second, how can we help the
broader community?</li>
<li>We may never get deployed to help the community. But, everything
learned here can be used to support oneself, family, neighborhood.</li>
<li>This is not the end all be-all. Continued training, refreshers,
radio, CPR, First Aid is encouraged. If you don't use it, you lose it.
Hard to remember everything.
<ul>
<li>This is more of an intro to disaster preparedness</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>stop the bleed class</em>: will be offered in the future (here),
sometime in the spring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to be prepared to mitigate/lesson impacts of disasters</li>
<li>All community members should take steps to prepare</li>
<li>Best when it is specific to idiosyncrasies of the community in
question.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Central coast doesn't need to prepare for tornadoes.</li>
<li>We need to prepare for earthquakes --&gt; power outages | fires |
blocked roads | food insecurity | power scarcity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Government</p>
<ul>
<li>gov't has responsibility to
<ul>
<li>dev test refine emergency plans</li>
<li>ensure responders are sufficiently equipped and skilled</li>
<li>services to protect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we are a small community, small gov't. so, we need to get by without
public services. thus, we need to be prepared.
<ul>
<li>Q: are services proportional to the population?</li>
<li>A: Yes, in the state of CA, more or less. In SBC, we're overstaffed
based on the table (2 ambulances, have 50 deputies) on paper
<ul>
<li>We are grossly understaffed due to turnover; wedged between a lot of
affluent regions (hard to recruit) with relatively small footprints</li>
<li>Distinction btw population vs land size. SBC is the state of RI in
land size, but the pop is more modest. lot of ground to cover.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Emergency Operations Plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigns resp to organizations and indiv (who does what)
<ul>
<li>in 2017, both fire and sheriffs where in charge, leading to a
pissing contest. Two diff command posts, didn't talk to each other,
wasn't effective.</li>
<li>Clear comms needed, as well as disjoint responsibilities, and a
clear chain of command.</li>
<li>Law enf is default responsible for evacuation. however, fire is in
charge of water rescue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Community leaders</p>
<ul>
<li>Elected personelle who have a responsibility to prepare community
<ul>
<li>participate on local planning councils</li>
<li>id and integrate resources into plans</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in 2017 floods, the shelter location was a place that wasn't
accepting animals; people won;t go there</li>
</ul>
<p>The Public</p>
<ul>
<li>Community alerts
<ul>
<li>SBC alerts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take training</li>
<li>Practice skills and personal plans</li>
<li>Networking, help others</li>
<li>Give feedback to community</li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise: Crash landing on the moon</p>
<ul>
<li>Situational awareness</li>
<li>Sizeup
<ul>
<li>Gather facts</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Types of disaster</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural</li>
<li>Technological</li>
<li>Intentional</li>
</ul>
<p>Key disaster elements</p>
<ul>
<li>No warning / unexpected
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, we do have an idea if there will be a disaster.
<ul>
<li>severe weather --&gt; evac warnings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are redundant systems (alerts, social media, etc.). But, it is
also upon you to have backup systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emergency personnel may be overwhelmed</li>
<li>Lives, health, and the environment are endangered</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Police, Fire, etc. aren't coming. You don't know. Should you go
or should you stay? How do you know?</em></p>
<p><em>Amateur Radio</em> is always the last form of communication for
disasters. GMRS Radios. Can purchase from box stores. See exam / club -
SBC has a club! May 3 you can get licensed! Radio can transmit messages
to cell phones far away! License is good for 10 years and covers your
entire family! Q: What do people do in a radio club? A: Meet once a
week, test phones / talk, set up repeaters, have better coverage than
cell phones!</p>
<p>Our dispatch center is still in SC. Call 911, it goes there, then
gets dispatched to local resources.</p>
<p>Firstnet? iPhone 14+ will switch to a satphone when cell goes
out!</p>
<p>Local Hazard Vulnerability</p>
<ul>
<li>Id most common disasters that occur</li>
<li>Id possible hazards with most severe impact</li>
<li>consider recent or historical impacts</li>
<li><em>Make sure your car isn't below half a tank!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What's the difference between an evauation order vs warning?</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning: you should go, please get you</li>
<li>Order: you needed to have been gone yesterday</li>
<li><em>Don't wait around for an evautaion order, leave at a
warning!</em></li>
<li>If you chose to ignore an order, there will be no emergency
response</li>
</ul>
<p>Dmg to infra</p>
<ul>
<li>Police are working on grave public safety stuff</li>
<li>FF suppressing major fires</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a law to offer mutual aid in disasters Q: How are needs
communicated in a response? A: Admin team works on this; contact {moab}?
other networks and ask for resources. CA has lots of such networks; goes
to a state level, goes to local region w/in state, then goes to partners
btw states.</p>
<p>Hazards related to structure type</p>
<ul>
<li>may not be able to select type of structure when a disaster
occurs</li>
<li>eng'd buildings have performed well in most types of disasters</li>
<li>in SBC, unrefnforced masonry, chimeneys, etc. were major hazards.
Newer buildings are reinforced and are very safe.
<ul>
<li>If possible, try to be in a building with sprinklers, that is
reinforced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need to know your escape routes for <em>you</em>.
<ul>
<li>How many exists does Nob Hill have? Safeway? Target? Where are they?
Have you ever looked for an exit besides the front door?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Hazards from Homes</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas line ruptures -- know how to shut off propane tanks</li>
<li>How do you shut off circuit breakers?
<ul>
<li>Electric shock potential? e.g. fridge, faulty wiring</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing for a disaster</p>
<ul>
<li>Know specific needs for yourself and your family.</li>
<li>The website has multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation plan.
<ul>
<li>Data updated every three years!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Protective actions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is really going on?
<ul>
<li>Is there gas actually leaking? Diff between what you prepared for vs
what is actually happening</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can we stay where we are, or do we need to leave?</li>
<li>Are there things we need to do to protect airways and breathing?
<ul>
<li>Do we need to cover windows cause the air is so bad?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do we have masks in the house to protect us from breathing chemicals
in the air?</li>
<li>How to rm contaminants from your home</li>
<li>Practice good hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sheltering</p>
<ul>
<li>in place: sealing a room</li>
<li>shelter for an extended time</li>
<li>mass care or community shelter</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev disaster plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a plan for where you'll meet family? Do you know how
you'll get there?</li>
<li>Who is your out-of-state check in contact?</li>
<li>How can you escape your home? Doors? Windows?</li>
<li>What's the safest place at work, school, church? What's the least
safe?</li>
<li>What routes can you use to escape your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Are you able to pick up your kids --&gt; when <em>everyone</em> is
doing the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Prep for disater</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you get your family out of your home and your go bag in 4
minutes
<ul>
<li>have in your car, at home, and at work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want to lesson the impact.
<ul>
<li>There's a small fire, and you can put it out. You have mitigated
that disaster.</li>
<li>If you have sufficient insurace, you can mitigate the disaster.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Things we can do in advance</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchor heavy furniture</li>
<li>brace bookcases to the wall</li>
<li>storm sutters?</li>
<li>childproof cabinet doors --&gt; even w/o little kids! big earthquake
prepareness. Child safety locks mitigates the mess!</li>
<li>locate and label gas, electricity, and water in your house to know
how to shut it off.
<ul>
<li>If you need a special tool: where is it? can you find it?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other mitigation measures</p>
<ul>
<li>Bold houses to foundation</li>
<li>Propane tanks and chimneys need to be secured</li>
<li>can you build a safe room? Can you hold up there for a while? What
can you do in a pinch?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortify your home</p>
<ul>
<li>fortify against home fires, mudslies, etc.</li>
<li>in Aromas, we have eukalyptus trees! so prone to fires! They are
shallow rooted!</li>
</ul>
<p>Get Invovled</p>
<ul>
<li>Req participation for all</li>
<li>Training and practice opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>CERT Disaster response</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond immediately after a fire</li>
<li>Be able to turn off your own utilities</li>
<li>Can you extinguish your own small fires?</li>
<li>Can you take care of injuries as much as possible until you can get
better treatment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal protective equipment</p>
<ul>
<li>Helmet</li>
<li>Goggles</li>
<li>N95 Mask</li>
<li>Gloves (work and non-latex)</li>
<li>Sturdy shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-disaster roles</p>
<ul>
<li>Id and aid neighbors/coworkers who might need assistance
<ul>
<li>Deploy in teams. When we deploy, we don't self-deploy in SBC, we do
when instructed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we get deployed, we wear protective equip</li>
<li>Make a plan, act on the plan, and re-evaluate. Turn over to
professionals when they arive.</li>
<li>Help with community events</li>
<li>Help with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How many CERT-trained people are in SBC? A: ??. Don't really have
a CERT team, but there isn't a cohesive organized org. Want to do things
on a scheduled basis. Goal: have cert team do the basic training and
other trainings. Would love to see a neighborhood watch! Engage with
community, see what they need, see how one can help, etc. CERT vs NERT
(neighborhood) NextDoor would be a good way to impl CERT -- comm
lines.</p>
<p>Aromas borders the three counties. Other counties do CERT training,
this county (SBC) was talking about doing its own CERT team! Want to get
Monterey and SC reps out there, too!</p>
<p>It needs to be both an indiv and team effort.</p>
<p>Q: When there is a call, when and how will it arrive ? A: It will
arrive from us, Anthony + office of emergency services. It's all one big
spider web pyramid structure.</p>
<p>Q: is there something below the CERT? e.g. I live in Santana ranch,
we use next door and text. I could go as part of that committee, have a
neighborhood thing, give them basic lessons A: No, there's not anything
organized at an official level.</p>
<p>CERT provides a legal structure -- insurance, liability, etc. Good
Samaritan law. Adv to being under an authority.</p>
<p>Q: If we get activated, is it on us to get to the location? A:
Yes.</p>
<p>Q: If an emergency did happen here, would you send a msg to all the
CERT team? A: We're not at that level yet. If we had a CERT team, we'd
have a roster, and call people out. CERT is strictly a volunteer org.
Let's say we made a call out, people would meet at the pre-design
staging area. That's the plan to eventually do that.</p>
<p>Protected for disaster workers</p>
<ul>
<li>CERT members are generally protected by good samaritan laws</li>
<li>Don't act outside of your training</li>
<li>Not our job to be law enforcement / stop people</li>
</ul>
<p>Other trainings</p>
<ul>
<li>AED: first thing when you enter a building: where are the AEDs.</li>
<li>Donations mgmt</li>
<li>Volunteers need to be managed, too. Sometimes, people have alterior
motives</li>
<li>You can spend forever on the FEMA websites.</li>
<li>Sometimes, CERT folks will pay for you to go to some of these
classes! e.g. first aid, shelter mgmt, etc.</li>
