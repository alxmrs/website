<h1 class="title">Alexes' Anniversary</h1>
<p class="date">2022-06-16</p>
</header>
<p>I got married a few weeks ago, and the strangest thing happened the
Friday before my <a href="/wedding">big day</a>. I headed to the barber
shop to get my beard cleaned up, as one does.</p>
<p>I got there right on time. "Alex for a 2:30 appointment?" I asked as
I entered the shop.</p>
<p>This question seemed to disgruntle the person in the waiting area
next to me. "<em>I'm</em> Alex who has a 2:30 appointment" he said as if
I was cutting in line.</p>
<p>Apparently, we both were right ‚Äî we were just scheduled to see
different barbers. We exchanged pleasant glances, and carried on with
our trims. I soon found myself chatting with my barber, talking about
how excited I was for my wedding.</p>
<p>The other Alex perks up. "You're getting married this weekend?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, this Sunday." I respond.</p>
<p>"This Sunday? Of Memorial Day weekend??"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's right." I'm a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>He chuckles. "<em>I</em> got married on Sunday of Memorial Day
weekend one year ago. My name is also Alex!"</p>
<p>"No way! What are the odds?" I think about how there are so may
Alexes. I'm not even the only Alex in my wedding party ‚Äî one of three if
you include plus-ones, and one of four Als (we also have an Alec).</p>
<p>"No kidding! So you're getting your hair cut for your wedding?"</p>
<p>"No, just a beard trim, but yes, it's for my wedding."</p>
<p>He laughs aloud. "You're not going to believe this ‚Äî I'm getting my
hair cut for a wedding... also Sunday of Memorial Day weekend!"</p>
<p>By now we each have stupid grins on our faces, though mine was a bit
more curious than his. He continues: "Guess what the groom's name
is?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Yup. It's Alex!"</p>
<details>
<summary>What <i>are</i> the odds?</summary>

<p>I thought a bit about how to solve this during my wedding weekend. I
<a href="/wedding/paradox">almost tried</a> to formalize and calculate a
solution. Instead, I went off to my honeymoon.</p>
