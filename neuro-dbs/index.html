<h1 class="title">Notes on "A Comparison of Neuroelectrophysiology
Databases"</h1>

<p>Paper compares 4 intracranial neuroelectrophysiology "data
repositories" (read: data formats):</p>
<ul>
<li>DABI: Data Archive for the BRAIN Initiative</li>
<li>DANDI: Distributed Archives for Neurophysiological Data
Integration</li>
<li>OpenNeuro</li>
<li>Brain CODE These two efforts also utilize NWB (Neurodata Without
Borders) and BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure).</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper calls this field "neuroinformatics." I really like
that.</p>
<p>One reason there's more iEEG (intercranial EEG) data available these
days is due to FDA approval of DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapies in
the last three decades.</p>
<p>Because this data is produced for primarily medical reasons, they
often also imply other forms of multi-modal imaging. For example,
imaging is likely taken in order to know where to properly place
electrodes. This leads to richer datasets.</p>
<p>Because these surgeries are so invasive and expensive, the production
of such neural data is quite rare. Thus, centralized datasets and data
standards are really important for the advancement of the field.</p>
<p>EEGLAB (from UCSD) and OpenNeuro (from Stanford) created NEMAR, the
Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource, in 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NIMH Data Archive</a>: <em>National
Institute of Mental Health</em> Data Archive. Makes data from human
subjects across many scientific domains anonymous and available. Not all
data is publicly available; many datasets have strict access
requirements.</p>
<p>Data governance definition (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data governance is critical in well-established archive management
and data asset control. It involves establishing frameworks that dictate
how data are collected, stored, accessed, shared, and organized.
<strong>In the context of data archives, data governance oversees the
entire archival process, encompassing data retention policies, security
measures, access controls, and data integrity and privacy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DANDI: a 2019 repository of neurophysiology and neuroimaging datasets
(i.e. "Dandisets") for human and non-human data. Led by scientists at
MIT and Dartmouth. Intended to aid in the adoption of BIDS, NWB, and
NIDM (Neuroimaging Data Model). Includes W3C Provenance data
(W3C-PROV).</p>
<p>OpenNeuro was developed from OpenFRMI.org.</p>
<p>HED: Hierarchical Event Descriptors. It's what NEMAR uses in addition
to BIDS.</p>
<p>On file formats (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A variety of neurophysiology data modalities (i.e., EEG, MEG, DBS,
and iEEG) results in a wide range of formats and structures, leading to
challenges in integrating and analyzing pooled data. <strong>The lack of
standardization of recorded file formats complicates building
large-scale datasets and requires file conversion.</strong> The
emergence of intracranial neurophysiology databases necessitated
improved standardization and harmonization protocols to ensure data
usability and integration. DABI, DANDI, OpenNeuro, and Brain-CODE offer
nuanced solutions to address this demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BIDS is becoming the leading standard for harmonizing imaging
data.</p>
<p>BIDS abstracts common metadata across different imaging modalities,
where each modality has its own data format (and history).</p>
<p>On NWB vs BIDS</p>
<ul>
<li>More common for cellular data, not as much for EEG or MEG</li>
<li>NWB requires conversion of underlying format within a NWB file,
unlike BIDS, which allows modality-specific formats.</li>
<li>The benefit of the host cost (conversion) is standardization, data
chunking and standard (lossless) compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>DANDI's platform requires data uploaders to adhere to data standards.
Cellular data is usually NWB; optical physiology uses OME-Zarr for
microscopy. Dandisets must adhere to BIDS-like lightweight file tree
hierarchy -- as provided by the dandi CLI. BIDS is required for
neuroimaging data (like structural MRI, fMRI). Metadata standards follow
NIDM. The team helps both NWB and BIDS in developing standards.</p>
<p>They point out this inherent tradeoff between strict and loose
adhereance to neuro data standards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some archives strictly adhere to standardization protocols, while
others offer more flexibility in accepted data formats. Data standards
make harmonization less challenging but may limit the amount of
collected data. On the other hand, accepting a broader range of formats
creates a harmonization hurdle. One solution is to accept formats that
can be converted into multiple acceptable data structures (e.g., BIDS or
NWB). While indiscriminate acceptance reduces time-consuming conversions
by providers, it leaves the harmonization task to users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, this is where Zarr Virtualization may really deliver a good
solution. What if the code complexity and storage costs of data
conversion was low?</p>
<p>Beyond standards, data sharing "protocols" limits analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many researchers elect to keep their datasets or metadata private,
while others upload incomplete sets, hindering the reanalysis efforts.
Some repositories allow data owners to upload agreements that require
co-authorship considerations, provide guidelines on crediting the sets,
and outline stipulations before releasing the data. BRAIN Initiative’s
guidelines for data sharing have continued to improve by adapting to the
needs of the data providers and users, removing ambiguity, and offering
a policy that can be uniformly implemented to enhance data sharing in
this field further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Canadian's Brain-CODE project mandates that data collected with
their funding has to be made option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Canada, OBI mandates that all Integrated Discovery (“ID”) Programs
it funds provide data to Brain-CODE to foster collaboration and data
sharing. Therefore, OBI’s policy on data sharing states that the data
produced through its funding should be accessible with minimal
constraints in a responsible and timely manner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper says that the existing data sharing efforts have led to
successes in Alzheimer's treatment. That's excellent!!</p>
<p>The paper calls out standard data collection processes, not just
post-processing standards, since post-processing can reduce the
underlying signal.</p>
<p>On standardization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, limiting the number of possible file formats or
proposing a universal format would eliminate the need for file
harmonization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe Zarr could be that file format!</p>
