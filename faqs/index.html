<summary>What do you do for work?</summary>

<div id="work"></div>

<p>I'm not working at the moment! However, I used to work at Google
Research. There, I developed machine-learning applications for the
weather. A lot of the time this involves making <a
href="/https://github.com/google/weather-tools/">weather data easier to
work with</a>, if not <a
href="/https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5">specific
datasets</a>. If you've Googled the weather and saw a bar that told you
how soon it was going to rain, you've used my <a
href="/https://blog.research.google/2023/11/metnet-3-state-of-art-neural-weather.html">old
team's main product</a>. Before this, I used to work on the <a
href="/https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs">Arcs project</a>, a system
to protect user privacy in the AI era. I've been lucky so far that a lot
of my work involves contributing to <a
href="/https://github.com/alxmrs">open source</a>. Before joining
Google, I've had a <a href="/cv">mix of software engineering and machine
learning roles</a>.</p>

<summary>Where are you from?</summary>

<div id="from"></div>

<p>All over California, really. I grew up in <a href="/san-diego">San
Diego</a> (north county) and went to college there, too. I lived in
Oakland for a few years, then in the Santa Cruz/Monterey area. During
the pandemic, I found myself in the central coast near SLO. When things
cleared up a bit, Cam and I moved to LA for a year to help support
family. Hey, maybe one day I'll end up in Chico or Mt. Shasta.</p>
<p>Currently, I live in Aromas, CA. (It's about 100 miles south of San
Francisco.)</p>

<summary>What's your favorite place that you've traveled to?</summary>

<p>Wow, what an impossible question! Well, I have a soft spot for
Vietnam. We only visited the <a
href="/https://vagabonvivants.com/chapter-17-good-morning-vietnam">top</a>
<a
href="/https://vagabonvivants.com/chapter-18-goodnight-vietnam">half</a>
of the country, but boy does it have it all: natural beauty, rich
culture and history, delicious food and, in my opinion, the best coffee
in the world. Next on my list is probably T√ºrkiye. There's something
really special about that place.</p>
<p>We're lucky enough to have spent a good deal of <a
href="/https://www.seat61.com/Vietnam.htm">time</a> <a
href="/https://www.seat61.com/train-travel-in-turkey.htm">on trains</a>
in both countries; I wonder if that has something to do with it.</p>

<summary>What kind of music do you like? What have you been listening to recently?</summary>

<div id="music"></div>

<p>Why, thank you for asking! In a world of streaming music, it's common
to say that one's tastes are eclectic. This certainly is true for me,
however, it doesn't really speak to the shape of my preferences. Let me
show rather than tell what I like (with the help of <a
href="/https://everynoise.com">everynoise.com</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="/https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=spotify:user:djbokonon">Here
are all my playlists</a>. I've been cataloguing all the songs I
encounter, saving the ones that are new-to-me in lists organized by
month &amp; year (since ~ 2016).</p></li>
<li><p>Try clicking on the "tracks" link for a playlist. For example, <a
href="/https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=2h0gMiVpHTnEdgk905lCSR">here
are the tracks</a> in my <code>2022 jan</code> playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>If a genre seems interesting to you, click the link to explore
artists that create music associated with that genre. For example, I
listen to a bunch of <a
href="/https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=genre&amp;name=art%20pop">art
pop</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<summary>Neat website. How's it made?</summary>

<p>Thanks! This website is mostly generated HTML and CSS. In an effort
to keep things simple, my generator consists of some shell scripts that
invoke <a href="/https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> (Check out the <a
href="/https://github.com/alxmrs/website">source</a>, or consider <a
href="/https://github.com/alxmrs/pandoc-website-template">making your
own</a> shell-powered website). I thought I would have to replace my
hacked-together solution with a "real" static site generator until I
found <a href="/https://github.com/chambln/pandoc-rss">this awesome
project</a> for generating an RSS feed! It seems like I'm not the only
pandoc obsessed developer out there (there are dozens of us!). I guess
the allure of creating a website in PowerPoint is too strong to let
go...</p>
<p>If you find any part of it that is not accessible or generally
unusable, please reach out to me, and I'll correct it.</p>

<details>

<summary>Do you have any advice for becoming a software engineer?</summary>

<p>Yes ‚Äì but that depends a lot on your situation. Please, email me (or
reach out some other way). I'm happy to give you my 2¬¢.</p>
<details>

<summary>I'm a UCSD undergraduate.</summary>

<p>Awesome. I get messages from UCSD undergrads from time to time. One
day, I'll write an article with general advice for students like you.
Until then, would you be interested in <a
href="/https://tritonsconnect.com/user/782505">connecting with me on
TritonsConnect</a>? From there, I can learn a bit more about you and
provide commensurate advice.</p>

<summary>Do you actually get asked these questions frequently?</summary>

<p>Like, not really.</p>
