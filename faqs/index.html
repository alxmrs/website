<summary>What do you do for work?</summary>

<div id="work"></div>

<p>I work at Google Research on the Anthromet team. Here, I develop
machine-learning applications for the weather. A lot of the time, this
involves making it <a
href="https://github.com/google/weather-tools/">easier to work with
weather data</a>, if not <a
href="https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5">specific
datasets</a>. Before this team, I used to work on the <a
href="https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs">Arcs project</a>, a system to
protect user privacy in the AI era. I've been lucky so far that a lot of
my work involves contributing to open source. Before joining Google,
I've had a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/almerose/">mix of
software engineering and machine learning roles</a>.</p>

<summary>Where are you from?</summary>

<div id="from"></div>

<p>All over California, really. I grew up in <a
href="/zettel/san-diego/">San Diego</a> (north county) and went to
college there, too. I lived in Oakland for a few years, then in the
Santa Cruz / Monterey area. During the pandemic, I found myself in the
central coast near SLO. Hey, maybe one day I'll end up in Chico or Mt.
Shasta.</p>

<summary>What kinds of things do you do for fun?</summary>

<div id="fun"></div>

<p>I used to fret this question. Especially its corollary: "What are
your hobbies?" For the longest time, I felt like I had no hobbies,
despite my best intentions at starting playing music or <a
href="/electric-origami/">creating art</a>. There never seemed to be any
time. Then, one day, my father-in-law dropped a bomb on me: Travelling
is my hobby. Until he said it, it never clicked that time spent
planning, packing, and unpacking for trips amounted to something!</p>
<p>I really enjoy traveling. I definitely got the travel bug while
coming of age. I visited my (then) college girlfriend while she studied
abroad in New Zealand. On this first major international trip without my
family, I saw NZ's north island and the island nation of Tonga. Since
graduating, I've had the pleasure of visiting several places in Europe.
I took a wonderful family trip to Havana, Cuba – we snuck that in during
the brief window when it was allowed! I got more comfortable with
international travel when I joined Google. My first team there was
primarily based on two cities: SF and Sydney. So, I got to travel to Aus
twice a year for work. In fact, my first week on the job after
orientation, my team flew me to Sydney! I was slowly but surely building
up more competence in travel, which begets an appetite to see more
places.</p>
<p>Cam &amp; I took a break from this during the height of the pandemic.
When travel became safer, we started to take excursions domestically. We
moved <a href="#from">all around California</a> and visited friends
&amp; family in the East Coast and Texas. To this day, we always seem to
have an upcoming place to visit.</p>
<p>Underscoring all of this, I'd say that what I value most of all is
being part of a community. I like to see family &amp; friends whenever
possible, even if this means going across state or country. I also like
to make friends out of strangers — I once made a friend on Bart!</p>

<summary>What kind of music do you like? What have you been listening to recently?</summary>

<div id="music"></div>

<p>Why, thank you for asking! In a world of streaming music, it's common
to say that one's tastes are eclectic. This certainly is true for me,
however, it doesn't really speak to the shape of my preferences. Let me
show rather than tell what I like (with the help of <a
href="https://everynoise.com">everynoise.com</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=user&amp;name=djbokonon">Here
are all my playlists</a>. I've been cataloguing all the songs I
encounter, saving the ones that are new-to-me in lists organized by
month &amp; year (since ~2016).</p></li>
<li><p>Try clicking on the "tracks" link for a playlist. For example, <a
href="https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=1UcLLHgGUDe8lBOuuuiN1Y">here
are the tracks</a> in my <code>Spring Refined 2016</code> playlist. Or,
consider viewing <a
href="https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=2NDxw8EduMlWC73ZSOJ21X">the
tracks of a more recent playlist</a>. These will give you a feel of the
music and subgenres that I like.</p></li>
<li><p>If a genre seems interesting to you, click the link to explore
artists that create music associated with that genre. For example, I
listen to a bunch of <a
href="https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=genre&amp;name=art%20pop">art
pop</a>.</p></li>

<summary>Neat website. How's it made?</summary>

<p>Thanks! This website is mostly generated HTML and CSS. In an effort
to keep things simple, my generator consists of some shell scripts that
invoke <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> (Check out the <a
href="https://github.com/alxmrs/website">source</a>, or consider <a
href="https://github.com/alxmrs/pandoc-website-template">making your
own</a> shell-powered website). I thought I would have to replace my
hacked-together solution with a "real" static site generator until I
found <a href="https://github.com/chambln/pandoc-rss">this awesome
project</a> for generating an RSS feed! It seems like I'm not the only
pandoc obsessed developer out there (there are dozens of us!). I guess
the allure of creating a website in PowerPoint too strong to let this
go...</p>
<p>If you find any part of it that is not accessible or generally
unusable, please reach out to me, and I'll correct it.</p>

<details>

<summary>Do you have any advice for becoming a software engineer?</summary>

<p>Yes – but that depends a lot on your situation. Please, email me (or
reach out some other way). I'm happy to give you my 2¢.</p>
<details>

<summary>I'm a UCSD undergraduate.</summary>

<p>Awesome. I get messages from UCSD undergrads from time to time. One
day, I'll write an article with general advice for students like you.
Until then, would you be interested in <a
href="https://tritonsconnect.com/user/782505">connecting with me on
TritonsConnect</a>? From there, I can learn a bit more about you and
provide commensurate advice.</p>

<summary>Do you actually get asked these questions frequently?</summary>

<p>Like, not really.</p>
