<summary>What do you do for work?</summary>

<div id="work"></div>

<p>I'm not working at the moment! However, I used to work at Google
Research. There, I developed machine-learning applications for the
weather. A lot of the time this involves making <a
href="https://github.com/google/weather-tools/">weather data easier to
work with</a>, if not <a
href="https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5">specific
datasets</a>. If you've Googled the weather and saw a bar that told you
how soon it was going to rain, you've used my <a
href="https://blog.research.google/2023/11/metnet-3-state-of-art-neural-weather.html">old
team's main product</a>. Before this, I used to work on the <a
href="https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs">Arcs project</a>, a system to
protect user privacy in the AI era. I've been lucky so far that a lot of
my work involves contributing to <a
href="https://github.com/alxmrs">open source</a>. Before joining Google,
I've had a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/almerose/">mix of
software engineering and machine learning roles</a>.</p>

<summary>Where are you from?</summary>

<div id="from"></div>

<p>All over California, really. I grew up in <a
href="/zettel/san-diego/">San Diego</a> (north county) and went to
college there, too. I lived in Oakland for a few years, then in the
Santa Cruz / Monterey area. During the pandemic, I found myself in the
central coast near SLO. When things cleared up a bit, Cam and I moved to
LA for a year to help support family. Hey, maybe one day I'll end up in
Chico or Mt. Shasta.</p>

<summary>What kinds of things do you do for fun?</summary>

<div id="fun"></div>

<p>I used to fret this question. Especially its corollary: "What are
your hobbies?" For the longest time, I felt like I had no hobbies,
despite my best intentions at starting playing music or <a
href="/electric-origami/">creating art</a>. There never seemed to be any
time. Then, one day, my father-in-law dropped a bomb on me: Travelling
is my hobby. Until he said it, it never clicked that time spent
planning, packing, and unpacking for trips amounted to something!</p>
<p>I really enjoy traveling. I definitely got the travel bug while
coming of age. I visited my (then) college girlfriend while she studied
abroad in New Zealand. On this first major international trip as an
adult, I saw NZ (north island only) and Tonga. We've used to do at least
one major trip per year once we started working, as folks do. I once
took a wonderful family trip to Havana, Cuba – we snuck that in during
the brief window when it was allowed for Americans! When I got my last
job, I started traveling internationally for work (primarily to Sydney),
which only gave me more of an apptetite to see more places.</p>
<p>Cam &amp; I took a break from this, of course, during the pandemic.
When travel became safer, we started to explore domestically. We moved
<a href="#from">all around California</a> and visited friends &amp;
family around North America. We would jump to new places even with the
flimsiest of excuses.</p>
<p>Right now (most likely, who has time to update FAQ pages?), Cam and I
are on a yearlong trip around the world. We quit our jobs on Friday the
13th of October 2023, to finally see the world to our heart's desire.
You can read about where we went or hear about where we're going to be
on our <a
href="https://vagabonvivants.substack.com/">newsletter</a>.</p>

<summary>What kind of music do you like? What have you been listening to recently?</summary>

<div id="music"></div>

<p>Why, thank you for asking! In a world of streaming music, it's common
to say that one's tastes are eclectic. This certainly is true for me,
however, it doesn't really speak to the shape of my preferences. Let me
show rather than tell what I like (with the help of <a
href="https://everynoise.com">everynoise.com</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=spotify:user:djbokonon">Here
are all my playlists</a>. I've been cataloguing all the songs I
encounter, saving the ones that are new-to-me in lists organized by
month &amp; year (since ~ 2016).</p></li>
<li><p>Try clicking on the "tracks" link for a playlist. For example, <a
href="https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=2h0gMiVpHTnEdgk905lCSR">here
are the tracks</a> in my <code>2022 jan</code> playlist.</p></li>
<li><p>If a genre seems interesting to you, click the link to explore
artists that create music associated with that genre. For example, I
listen to a bunch of <a
href="https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=genre&amp;name=art%20pop">art
pop</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<summary>Neat website. How's it made?</summary>

<p>Thanks! This website is mostly generated HTML and CSS. In an effort
to keep things simple, my generator consists of some shell scripts that
invoke <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> (Check out the <a
href="https://github.com/alxmrs/website">source</a>, or consider <a
href="https://github.com/alxmrs/pandoc-website-template">making your
own</a> shell-powered website). I thought I would have to replace my
hacked-together solution with a "real" static site generator until I
found <a href="https://github.com/chambln/pandoc-rss">this awesome
project</a> for generating an RSS feed! It seems like I'm not the only
pandoc obsessed developer out there (there are dozens of us!). I guess
the allure of creating a website in PowerPoint too strong to let this
go...</p>
<p>If you find any part of it that is not accessible or generally
unusable, please reach out to me, and I'll correct it.</p>

<details>

<summary>Do you have any advice for becoming a software engineer?</summary>

<p>Yes – but that depends a lot on your situation. Please, email me (or
reach out some other way). I'm happy to give you my 2¢.</p>
<details>

<summary>I'm a UCSD undergraduate.</summary>

<p>Awesome. I get messages from UCSD undergrads from time to time. One
day, I'll write an article with general advice for students like you.
Until then, would you be interested in <a
href="https://tritonsconnect.com/user/782505">connecting with me on
TritonsConnect</a>? From there, I can learn a bit more about you and
provide commensurate advice.</p>

<summary>Do you actually get asked these questions frequently?</summary>

<p>Like, not really.</p>
