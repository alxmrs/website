<p>I like surprises, but <a
href="https://camille.merose.com">Camille</a> doesn't. She'd rather be
able to look forward to things. For her, half the pleasure of enjoying,
say, a vacation comes purely from its anticipation.</p>
<p>I had a challenge before me: How could I give Cam the biggest
surprise of her life while also letting her look forward to it?</p>
<p>I originally had the idea to propose to Camille around the end of
year holidays. Every year, a few days leading up to Christmas, Camille's
family take a trip to the cabins of Yosemite valley. Proposals at
Yosemite Christmas, in the Cary family, are practically an unofficial
tradition. Unfortunately for me, the <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/wedding/ring/">engagement ring</a> I had picked
out needed more time to be made. And, wouldn't it be nice to pave my own
way? While a proposal in front of family is great, I wanted the moment
to honor the character of our relationship.</p>
<p>Christmas' day of 2019, I acted super weird. I let on that I was
giving Camille a Big Gift™, the vibes of which she definitely picked up
on. I am not a good liar. You should see my total absence of a poker
face when we play cards at Yosemite Christmas <a href="#1">[1]</a>. The
way I pulled off authentic engagement-ring-under-the-tree energy was by
giving Camille a trip for Christmas. I gave her a vacation to New
Orleans for the start of Mardi Gras, over Valentines Day weekend.</p>
<p>Camille and I love jazz. Since we got together in 2012, music has
been a cornerstone of our relationship. And, as you can <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/pesto/">probably guess</a>, Camille and I love
food. For these reasons (and the allure of gator tours), Cam and I have
talked about going to New Orleans together for forever.</p>
<p>"I was sure that he was going to propose in New Orleans," Grandma
Shirley would tell us later. I'm glad I gave off that impression. I had
something different in mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/my-proposal-cemetery.webp"
alt="The cemetery by our house" /></p>
<p>When we landed in Oakland, we ended up living nearby the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View_Cemetery_(Oakland,_California)">Mountain
View Cemetery</a> <a href="#2">[2]</a>. If you're not familiar with <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/9aeAdYfmShjbVVva9">the area</a>, the cemetery
acts somewhat like a public park. It has a stunning view of the San
Francisco Bay, including parts of the Bay Bridge. Camille and I would
often find ourselves taking a stroll in the cemetery while talking about
our lives. We would go there with a pad of paper whenever we needed to
make a big decision, ornate headstones being our preferred backdrop to
make defining choices. Along the way of figuring out the right <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/wedding/ring/">engagement ring</a>, I knew that
I wanted to propose to Camille here.</p>
<p>The day of the proposal was like any other day – except I dressed
nicer than usual and was very nervous. I had to overcome what felt like
a bunch of wrenches thrown at me to get the timing just right. It was a
Friday, a week before Valentines day, and half a week from our vacation
to New Orleans. Camille was attending an all weekend <a
href="https://www.wildmed.com/course-type/wilderness-first-responder/">WFR</a>
training, so I was running out of time. I had just gotten the engagement
ring in my hands Thursday, after months of planning. Now, it was go
time. All I had to do was convince Camille to take a walk with me in the
cemetery after work.</p>
<p>Camille didn't want to go! Another complication: She was training for
a half-marathon, which included a weekly 10-mile run, which she had
taken <em>that day</em>. Why was I making her go on walk? Couldn't we
just stay at the house and hang out?</p>
<p>I had to think fast to come up with a good excuse. "No, let's go on a
walk so we can talk shit about our roommates," I told her. She was
down.</p>
<p>We gossiped as we strolled down the Ave. I don't remember how the
conversation shifted when we got to the cemetery. All I remember is that
it was sunset when I popped down on one knee. My proposal speech was a
remembrance of when we first started dating, and she asked me where our
relationship was going. I had flown across the world to see her in New
Zealand, only four months into being an item. We were in a car, and it
was raining. Back then, I told her that we were choosing each other
every day. In the cemetery, almost eight years later, I told her that I
want to choose her for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was a dream. We went to happy hour at <a
href="https://wineonpiedmont.com/">Wine on Piedmont</a>, as was our
traditional Friday night activity. I got a reservation at the excellent
sicilian place on our block. We had an exciting trip to look forward to.
I got my wish – Cam was surprised.</p>
