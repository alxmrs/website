<h1 class="title">Why I’m going on a digital detox</h1>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking: Elon Musk has just reinstated Donald Trump’s Twitter account.</p>&mdash; No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen (@NoLieWithBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoLieWithBTC/status/1594136753949974530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I’m reading <a href="https://g.co/kgs/GW6WUJ">Cal Newport’s
<em>Digital Minimalism</em></a> right now. What a perfect time to do
this, just as Twitter is on the Musk train to hell.</p>
<p>The book is making me notice how little I really get out of my media
consumption habits. Screen Time shows that I spend four to five hours a
day on my phone (<em>edit: I have mislead myself here by looking at
weeks where I was on vacation. Though, my point still stands with
spending 2 hours per day on a screen, too</em>). That’s a part time job
amount of time — so, what am I getting out of it? Newport is helping me
understand the answer is not much. I’m mostly addicted to social apps
that I probably use to escape emotions instead of process them. While I
may get some utility from these platforms, they mostly exploit my
attention for profit. This provides a high opportunity cost: what if I
spent this second job worth of free time on “high quality leisure”
instead?</p>
<p>I’m taking the same approach in reading this book as I did when I
quite smoking. To quit cigarettes, I read <a
href="https://g.co/kgs/LBFdQF">Allen Carr’s <em>The Easy Way</em></a>,
where I didn’t have to stop lighting up until I finished reading the
book. This book actually worked. After finishing it, I never had a
cigarette again.</p>
<p>I’m reading <em>Digital Minimalism</em> and am using social media at
the same time. I find myself asking why I even like it in the first
place. <em>The East Way</em> goes on and on about how you don’t actually
like smoking. Smoking make you feel anxious and big tobacco has
brainwashed you into thinking that a cigarette will make this go away
(you are temporarily free from withdrawal pain that cigarettes cause). I
feel the same effect with my phone: media makes me feel anxious, from
FOMO or boredom or emotional processing debt, and it offers me the
ability to kick the can down the road once more. Cal Newport is less
hypnotizing than Carr, but he is effective nevertheless.</p>

<p>The algorithms can see my disappointment, or the universe is trying
to send me a message, because these are the posts I’ve seen recently
about the state of social media:</p>

<p>Hackernews has been the same for 10 years. What’s there to miss out
on?</p>

<p>Given all this, I’m taking a digital detox come December.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-digital-detox">What’s a digital detox?</h2>
<p>Newport calls this a digital declutter, which is a more accurate
description. The idea is to learn to live without most digital
technology for a while so that you know what small bit of it is worth
keeping.</p>
<p>I’ve not really done the book justice with my summary of it here. For
a better overview, I recommend my friend Alexander’s post.</p>
<p><a href="https://awsaavedra.com/posts/digital-minimalism/">Digital
Minimalism</a></p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-here">How did I get here?</h2>
<p>I don’t think it’s always been this bad. As recently as 2019, I felt
pretty at peace with my digital media consumption. I probably still
spent too much time online, but I didn’t really mind. My wife and I were
putting our phones to sleep well before our own bedtime. I consumed a
lot of news and social media, but it didn’t feel so all-consuming.
Around that time, I had successfully tamped down my intake of charged
political posts.</p>
<p>The pandemic made a huge difference in my habits. Stuck inside and
cut off from most human connections, I gave myself permission to do
whatever I needed to get by. With little else to do I spent
<em><strong>way</strong></em> more time online. In the middle of the
pandemic, I started using TikTok, a much more potent content aggregator
than I’ve ever used before.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-hope-for-next">What can I hope for next?</h2>
<p>Instead of connecting more with others online, I’m more looking
forward for the opportunity to connect more with myself. I’d like to
spend more time creating in <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/boredom/">solitude</a>, including writing. I
really like Newport’s recommendation to write more letters to yourself.
I do some form of this already, though I do hope to make it more of a
regular habit.</p>
<p>As far as keeping up with people, I’m already the weird one in my
friend groups who randomly calls people on the phone. And, I have no
trouble meeting new people in real life – I once made a friend on
Bart!</p>
