<title>Alexes’ Anniversary</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I got married a few weeks ago, and the
strangest thing happened the Friday before my <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/wedding/">big day</a>. I headed to the barber
shop to get my beard cleaned up, as one does.</p>
<p>I got there right on time. “Alex for a 2:30 appointment?” I asked as
I entered the shop.</p>
<p>This question seemed to disgruntle the person in the waiting area
next to me. “<em>I’m</em> Alex who has a 2:30 appointment” he said as if
I was cutting in line.</p>
<p>Apparently, we both were right — we were just scheduled to see
different barbers. We exchanged pleasant glances, and carried on with
our trims. I soon found myself chatting with my barber, talking about
how excited I was for my wedding.</p>
<p>The other Alex perks up. “You’re getting married this weekend?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, this Sunday.” I respond.</p>
<p>“This Sunday? Of Memorial Day weekend??”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right.” I’m a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>He chuckles. “<em>I</em> got married on Sunday of Memorial Day
weekend one year ago. My name is also Alex!”</p>
<p>“No way! What are the odds?” I think about how there are so may
Alexes. I’m not even the only Alex in my wedding party — one of three if
you include plus-ones, and one of four Als (we also have an Alec).</p>
<p>“No kidding! So you’re getting your hair cut for your wedding?”</p>
<p>“No, just a beard trim, but yes, it’s for my wedding.”</p>
<p>He laughs aloud. “You’re not going to believe this — I’m getting my
hair cut for a wedding… also Sunday of Memorial Day weekend!”</p>
<p>By now we each have stupid grins on our faces, though mine was a bit
more curious than his. He continues: “Guess what the groom’s name
is?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Yup. It’s Alex!”</p>
<details>
<summary>
What <i>are</i> the odds?
</summary>
<p>I thought a bit about how to solve this during my wedding weekend. I
<a href="https://alxmrs.com/wedding/paradox/">almost tried</a> to
formalize and calculate a solution. Instead, I went off to my
honeymoon.</p>

<title>Random ideas to solve Alex’s Anniversary Paradox</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><em>WIP?</em></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a bunch about how to tackle <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/anniversary/">this problem</a>. It seems like
my trip to the barber shop seems like a weird variant of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday
Paradox</a>: What is the probability, in a group of <code>n</code>
randomly chosen people, at least three will have the same name and
wedding day?</p>
<p>I’ve poked around stats exchange and found some <a
href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1718">general solutions</a> to
the birthday paradox, including an <a
href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/335132">R implementation</a>.
Though, I’m not convinced that this is a good approach. How do you
maintain assumptions and also account for names?</p>
<p>It seems like a better way would be to collect data on birthdays and
wedding anniversaries, and calculate the distribution. A project for
another day…</p>]]></description>

<title>Cootie Catchers &amp; Thoughts on Electric Origami</title>

origami</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was reading hacker news aimlessly on the couch, as one does when
home alone on a Sunday afternoon, when I came across <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27254480">this post</a>.
Printable circuits with a cheap inkjet printer? How exciting! Think of
the possibilities!</p>
<p>I shared the post with a few of my friends. <a
href="https://jbdoar.github.io/">Jason</a> got back to me, and we
started thinking about what we could do with this kind of tech.</p>
<p>Soon, the idea occurred to me: how about creating a little toy <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_fortune_teller">paper
fortune-teller</a> (or cootie catcher) that completes a circuit. Like,
it could turn on lights or make sounds, depending on how the
fortune-teller was folded. A bonus point about making a simple paper
toy: I am getting married in about a year, and wanted to have some sort
of interactive art thing at my wedding. With a hacked circuit printer, I
could create a viable electronic at the scale of a wedding while staying
on budget. Guests could fold their own cootie catcher, add LEDs and a
battery, and then play games with each other at cocktail hour. How
fun!</p>
<p>But, would it even work? I Googled around a bit and came to learn
that all the components of this project are pretty cheap. I ordered a
circuit ink pen and some electronics, and moved on to thinking about the
design.</p>
<p>I folded myself a fortune-teller and began thinking of how the
circuit would work. Here was my prototype v0.0:</p>
<figure>

alt="v0.0 of my electric paper fortune-teller" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">v0.0 of my electric paper
fortune-teller</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I used quarters here in place of <a
href="https://www.batteriesandbutter.com/RV1025.html">coin-sized
batteries</a>. The lines represent paths with conductive ink, and the
black dots should become contact points for the batteries when
folded.</p>
<p>As you can see, when you press the “B” dots together, two outside
LEDs would turn on.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/v00-b-pressed.png"
alt="v0.0 of a fortune-teller with the “B” circuit activated." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">v0.0 of a fortune-teller with the “B”
circuit activated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you press the “A” dots together, light would shine through the
center of the fortune teller.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/v00-a-pressed.png"
alt="v0.0 of a fortune-teller with the “A” circuit activated." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">v0.0 of a fortune-teller with the “A”
circuit activated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This seems fine, but I imagine using two batteries could get pricey
at the scale of ~200 guests for our wedding (not to mention, wasteful).
How could I create the catcher such that it used only one battery?</p>
<p>I unfolded the fortune-teller and tried to model the connections more
abstractly as a graph. The dotted lines below represent folded
connections, whereas solid lines would be silver-ink connections in
paper.</p>
<figure>

alt="Representing the problem as a graph." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Representing the problem as a

</figure>
<p>I noticed that the dotted lines here weren’t telling the whole
picture: Each line is associated with a connection “mode.” While alpha
was connected, beta wasn’t, and visa versa.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding modes to the graph.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The aspiring math teacher in me wants to ask: How would you draw the
circuit? It was fun for me to solve, and if you’ve read this far, I
imagine it would be fun for you too.</p>
<details>
<summary>
My Solution
</summary>
<p>
So, to come up with a more efficient solution, I tried to sketch out a
consistent solid line graph for each mode. After one incorrect attempt,
I figured out a configuration that would complete a full circuit for
each mode with only one battery.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/graph-answer.png" title="A solution to my simple graph problem">
</p>
<p>
(the trick was to cross the “A” connections)
</p>
<p>
This seemed good so far. However, for this to work, my graph needs to be
planar. Can I fit the one-battery circuit on one page?
</p>
<p>
The answer was “yes!” With another sketch, I had v0.1 of my design:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/catcher-v01.png" title="v0.1 of my electric paper fortune-teller">
</p>
</details>
<hr />
<p>Folded together, the circuit would turn on two outer LEDs when “A”
was pressed together, and the two other LEDs when “B” was pressed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/v01-a-pressed.png"

alt="v0.1 of a fortune-teller with the “B” circuit activated." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">v0.1 of a fortune-teller with the “B”
circuit activated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I told Jason all this, and he asked a good question: Would the silver
ink connections remain robust during folding? I did a quick inspect of
every crease, and to my best estimation, it seems to be the case! – no
short circuits.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/catcher-v01-short-front.png"

alt="An inspection for shorts of the v0.1 design, back" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An inspection for shorts of the v0.1
design, back</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Later, Jason would point out something that would require an
adjustment in my design. In v0.0, I was relying on each battery making
contact with the silver ink. However, in v0.1, as displayed in the
picture, I need to rely on a different mechanism to complete the
circuit. The cootie catcher needs to be folded in a way such that each
face of the battery makes contact with the silver ink. All this means is
that the position for my battery needs to be re-worked; it’s not a total
deal breaker.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll run into other issues that I can’t anticipate. I feel
pretty good about being able to sort those out as I complete v1.x of
this prototype, once my supplies arrive.</p>
<p>While I wait, I can’t help but dream of other possibilities based on
this simple experience.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that the kind of folks who find origami satisfying
probably overlap quite a bit with the folks who find circuit building
satisfying. The prospect of accessible printable circuits offers a
unique opportunity to cater to both audiences at once.</p>
<p>To generalize here, what if I could create a series of novel,
origami-based puzzles? Like, you get a piece of paper with normal ink
lines to indicate folds. A conductive ink layer interspersed with LEDs
offers the origamist clues on the fold order, guiding them to make the
origami shape by turning on lights.</p>
<p>Imagine creating a program to model circuits that live on folded
paper. Nodes could be polygons from folds with various types of
circuitry. Different kinds of edges might express relationships based on
neighborship on a plane or fold. Maybe we could speed up writing such a
program by extending existing PCB-design software. But, can it handle
the topological challenge?</p>
<p>Jason had fascinating ideas along the lines of different kinds of
circuit patterns. For one, he suggested the possibility of using
photoresistor and LED as a new type of interactive connection similar to
a fold. In this scheme, a circuit is complete when the active LED is
near the photoresistor and broken when they are apart. He had a few
other ideas of other types of circuits that could be used to make new
“edges” or interactive, foldable connections.</p>
<p>Jason’s current area of exploration: Paper planes.</p>
<p>What other kind of cool contraptions could we
make?</p>]]></description>

<title>My Proposal</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<description><![CDATA[<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/my-proposal-ring.jpg"
alt="Me just after I’ve proposed" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Me just after I’ve proposed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I like surprises, but <a
href="https://camille.merose.com">Camille</a> doesn’t. She’d rather be
able to look forward to things. For her, half the pleasure of enjoying,
say, a vacation comes purely from its anticipation.</p>
<p>I had a challenge before me: How could I give Cam the biggest
surprise of her life while also letting her look forward to it?</p>
<p>I originally had the idea to propose to Camille around the end of
year holidays. Every year, a few days leading up to Christmas, Camille’s
family take a trip to the cabins of Yosemite valley. Proposals at
Yosemite Christmas, in the Cary family, are practically an unofficial
tradition. Unfortunately for me, the <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/wedding/ring/">engagement ring</a> I had picked
out needed more time to be made. And, wouldn’t it be nice to pave my own
way? While a proposal in front of family is great, I wanted the moment
to honor the character of our relationship.</p>
<p>Christmas’ day of 2019, I acted super weird. I let on that I was
giving Camille a Big Gift™, the vibes of which she definitely picked up
on. I am not a good liar. You should see my total absence of a poker
face when we play cards at Yosemite Christmas <a href="#1">[1]</a>. The
way I pulled off authentic engagement-ring-under-the-tree energy was by
giving Camille a trip for Christmas. I gave her a vacation to New
Orleans for the start of Mardi Gras, over Valentines Day weekend.</p>
<p>Camille and I love jazz. Since we got together in 2012, music has
been a cornerstone of our relationship. And, as you can <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/pesto/">probably guess</a>, Camille and I love
food. For these reasons (and the allure of gator tours), Cam and I have
talked about going to New Orleans together for forever.</p>
<p>“I was sure that he was going to propose in New Orleans,” Grandma
Shirley would tell us later. I’m glad I gave off that impression. I had
something different in mind.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/my-proposal-cemetery.jpg"
alt="The cemetery by our house" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The cemetery by our house</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When we landed in Oakland, we ended up living nearby the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View_Cemetery_(Oakland,_California)">Mountain
View Cemetery</a> <a href="#2">[2]</a>. If you’re not familiar with <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/9aeAdYfmShjbVVva9">the area</a>, the cemetery
acts somewhat like a public park. It has a stunning view of the San
Francisco Bay, including parts of the Bay Bridge. Camille and I would
often find ourselves taking a stroll in the cemetery while talking about
our lives. We would go there with a pad of paper whenever we needed to
make a big decision, ornate headstones being our preferred backdrop to
make defining choices. Along the way of figuring out the right <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/wedding/ring/">engagement ring</a>, I knew that
I wanted to propose to Camille here.</p>
<p>The day of the proposal was like any other day – except I dressed
nicer than usual and was very nervous. I had to overcome what felt like
a bunch of wrenches thrown at me to get the timing just right. It was a
Friday, a week before Valentines day, and half a week from our vacation
to New Orleans. Camille was attending an all weekend <a
href="https://www.wildmed.com/course-type/wilderness-first-responder/">WFR</a>
training, so I was running out of time. I had just gotten the engagement
ring in my hands Thursday, after months of planning. Now, it was go
time. All I had to do was convince Camille to take a walk with me in the
cemetery after work.</p>
<p>Camille didn’t want to go! Another complication: She was training for
a half-marathon, which included a weekly 10-mile run, which she had
taken <em>that day</em>. Why was I making her go on walk? Couldn’t we
just stay at the house and hang out?</p>
<p>I had to think fast to come up with a good excuse. “No, let’s go on a
walk so we can talk shit about our roommates,” I told her. She was
down.</p>
<p>We gossiped as we strolled down the Ave. I don’t remember how the
conversation shifted when we got to the cemetery. All I remember is that
it was sunset when I popped down on one knee. My proposal speech was a
remembrance of when we first started dating, and she asked me where our
relationship was going. I had flown across the world to see her in New
Zealand, only four months into being an item. We were in a car, and it
was raining. Back then, I told her that we were choosing each other
every day. In the cemetery, almost eight years later, I told her that I
want to choose her for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was a dream. We went to happy hour at <a
href="https://wineonpiedmont.com/">Wine on Piedmont</a>, as was our
traditional Friday night activity. I got a reservation at the excellent
sicilian place on our block. We had an exciting trip to look forward to.
I got my wish – Cam was surprised.</p>

<title>How I chose an engagement ring</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/ring/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>When I first started looking for a ring, I was
looking at how much bang for my buck I could get in diamond sizes… which
was totally the wrong way to go about it. Cam wouldn’t want a big rock
on an ugly ring – it would get in the way and be a liability! Besides,
the ring had to compliment her style and personality.</p>
<p>The trick that worked for me to better figure out what would best
suit her was to talk <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/briannabanananana/">to</a> <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/sleepiegirl/">her</a> <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/ro.riches/">friends</a> . I ended up
starting a group chat with a few of her closest gals to gather intel.
Turns out that they regularly would share what kinds of jewelry / rings
that they liked. In any case, they had a much better idea of where to
start looking than I did.</p>
<p>For Cam, I knew that I wanted to get an environmentally friendly,
conflict-free diamond. I thought I would go towards the lab-grown
variety. However, her friends pointed me towards place like <a
href="https://fiatluxsf.com/">Fiat Lux</a> , <a
href="http://www.anastassiasel.com/">Anastassia Sel Jewelry</a>, <a
href="https://www.asraigarden.com/">asrai garden</a>, and <a
href="https://sofiazakia.com/">Sofia Zakia</a>. Not only do these
jewelers only source ethical stones, they also fit Camille’s style.</p>
<p>Here’s a general overview of how ordering a ring went down.</p>
<ul>
<li>FiatLux was based in San Francisco and located a quick BART ride
away from my office.</li>
<li>Visited them for the first time w/ <a
href="https://eatbigger.fish/">eve</a>. This was early October.</li>
<li>Met <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thee.georgie/">Georgie</a>,
who was awesome and would help me find the perfect ring.</li>
<li>Narrowed down various styles of rings while outlining which type of
stone to get.</li>
<li>From a (much) earlier convo with Camille, I knew that she liked
grey, imperfect diamonds.</li>
<li>I said that I wanted a hexagonal stone, and a ring to match.</li>
<li>Later, Georgie would find three stones; the middle one had the
greatest color in the light.</li>
<li>At thanksgiving without Camille, I couldn’t keep in my excitement
and blurted that I was ring shopping to my family. I showed them the
options I had. My Aunti <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/roz_creativestylist/">Rasmit</a> said
that I should go with the biggest stone.</li>
<li>I went with my gut and chose the middle-sized stone that was
elongated and had a beautiful shimmer. I also paired it with a <a
href="https://fiatluxsf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3595-W.jpg">Casia
Vestra</a>.</li>
<li>Once I decided, it was time to wait. I ordered the ring around late
November, with general plans to propose at the beginning of the new
year.</li>
<li>Turns out there is a holiday rush to make rings in time for end of
year proposals! That’s ok, by then, I changed my plans to pop the
question before Valentines day. The ring should be ready by then,
right?</li>
<li>Turns out the holiday rush can quickly turn into the Valentines’ day
rush. There were fewer and fewer days in my 10-day period to pop the
question, and the ring was still not ready. The weekend before our
Valentines day trip was not available to me to have a spontaneous
proposal, because Cam was enrolled in a wilderness medicine orientation
and would be busy the whole time!</li>
<li>The ring came, like, one week before my trip, on a Wednesday. It was
just in time for me to propose the way I wanted to. I had the wiggle
room of two days to <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/proposal/">propose</a>.</li>

<title>15 minutes of boredom a day</title>
<pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/boredom/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A week ago (late 2020), <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/goals/">I started a new habit</a>: I now try to
find 15 minutes of boredom a day.</p>
<p>These are uninterrupted periods of no stimulation. I have my phone
off or in another room. I avoid screens in general. No music plays in
the background. I just sit there alone with my thoughts and perceptions
– preferably outside.</p>
<p>I find my 15 minutes to be exhilarating. They start out… boring. Soon
enough, my mind will wonder and I’ll enjoy following its path.</p>
<p>I’ll sing the earworm stuck in my head while thinking about the next
revision of the <a
href="https://editor.p5js.org/alxrsngrtn/sketches/8Ndif6Ngl">hex tile
art</a> I’m working on. I’ll dig into a <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/zettel/determinism/">joke my wife made about
me</a> and reflect on what it means. I’ll think of articles I want to
write. I’ll think about thinking.</p>
<p>Whereas <a href="https://alxmrs.com/ice/">meditation</a> focuses on
the absence of thought in favor of presence, 15 minutes of boredom helps
me form ideas. I find the ritual to be refreshing even when I bear no
new thoughts. I relish the opportunity for peace and emotional
reflection.</p>]]></description>

<title>Emails to Self</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/emails/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Tip: For better work-life balance, consider
sending emails to your self.</p>
<p>Separate your work and personal apps across devices. Don’t always be
available to receive work messages – when you close your laptop, work
should be done.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this separation, for me, is that shutting a
laptop doesn’t stop the spontaneous flow of ideas. Maybe when your <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/boredom/">brain is trying to relax</a>, you
think of a small TODO that will make tomorrow better. Or, you feel
inspired to create something work related. Maybe you’ve encountered an
article in your feeds that you’d like to share with a co-worker.</p>
<p>Just send the thought from your personal to your work email. It’ll be
waiting for you in your inbox tomorrow. Thereafter, you can resume your
non-working life.</p>]]></description>

<title>Goal Setting</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/goals/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, the year I graduated from college, <a
href="https://camille.merose.com">my partner, Camille,</a> gave me a <a
href="https://passionplanner.com">Passion Planner</a>.</p>
<p>This planner is a journal / ideation system that helps you figure out
what you want in life, and then helps you realize it. A guide designed
by someone who felt adrift after her own graduation, it was exactly what
I needed.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://passionplanner.com/products/passion-roadmap">system</a>
works something like this: First, you brainstorm ways how you would like
to change your life (or what you’d like to accomplish). Then, you
organize your top goals per various time spans (lifetime, 3 years, 1
year, 3 months). Lastly, you break down the goals into a specific
<em>plan of action</em>, where you get to hold yourself accountable.
This plan of action involves literally scheduling milestones, reminders,
and due dates in the rest of the book (it’s a planner, after all).</p>
<p>I have to admit, the <em>planner</em> part of “Passion Planner” never
stuck for me. I don’t really keep track of my time or tasks on paper; I
prefer to use digital calendars and reminder systems. However, the model
of this book has given me a great sense of structure for my life. It
involves making monthly check-ins, to see if your actions are aligning
with your goals. In addition, I have a larger check-in at the end of the
year, to contemplate annual progress and cast new goals.</p>
<p>The process gives me the opportunity to reflect on the <a
href="/zettel/determinism">shape of my life</a>. It feels great to
accomplish a goal I’ve set. Better still: it’s a real joy to see how
your goals change over time.</p>]]></description>

<title>Hypertext a la Zettelkasten</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="hypertext-a-la-zettelkasten">Hypertext a
la Zettelkasten</h1>
<p>Ideally, I don’t want my website to be <em>just</em> a blog.</p>
<p>I don’t think in terms of sequences of posts. I am not trying to
create a newsletter – while this seems fun, the upkeep feels like more
of a burden than empowered expression. Why not, instead, aim to express
systems of ideas free of time?</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://alxmrs.com/zettel/ideas/">lot of ideas</a>,
but most of them are small and only make sense in context with other
thoughts. While I can often coalesce these scattered thoughts into
coherent essays, this takes time and effort I seldom muster.</p>
<p><a href="https://alxmrs.com/goals/">Every new years day</a> I
conceive of a “nice-to-have” resolution to start writing. Visions dance
before me of emulating great technical blogs that I spend the year
reading. Alas, it never goes this way, due to a sense of perfectionism
and habit inertia.</p>
<p>My dear friend <a href="http://eatbigger.fish">eve</a> mentioned the
other day that they were getting into this style of hypertext called <a
href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">Zettelkasten</a>. Parsing
the (admittedly, lengthy) introduction filled me with excitement – this
is the approach that I’m looking for.</p>
<p>My intentions, given this new style of thinking, are as follows: -
Organize the media in my life into a web of atomic connections, based on
the Zettelkasten method and my own preferences for hypertext media. -
What media? Why not include every bookmark saved for later, every note
scrawled on my phone, all the (legible) journal pages I’ve deemed
publishable, and every podcast episode that’s filled me with joy? - ???
- Profit.</p>
<p>Well, let’s see how this experiment goes.</p>
<p>I’ll update this page with entry-points into my
Zettlekasten.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>My partner’s food intuition – her ability to
weave haphazard ingredients into a coherent, delicious meal – is nothing
short of magic.</p>
<p>Here are a few meals we’ve made together that I’d like to
remember.</p>
<h2 id="farmers-market-mushroom-pasta">farmers market mushroom
pasta</h2>
<em>2020-Oct-17</em>
<details>
<summary>
behind the recipe
</summary>
<p>We had just picked up fresh <a
href="https://www.montereybayfarmers.org/markets-hours/carmel-farmers-market/carmel-vendors/pensi-pasta-company-carmel">porcini
mushroom pasta</a> from the local farmers market. Such a fine ingredient
required a worthy recipe to go with it. What we cooked was inspired by
<a
href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-pasta-with-crispy-mushrooms">Bon
Appétit’s “Creamy pasta with crispy mushrooms”</a>. Instead of oil,
Camille chose to cook the mushrooms in butter because “mushrooms and
butter belong together.”</p>
<p>Before she cooked the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium">alliums</a>, Camille had the
idea that this dish would be great with Alison Roman’s crispy
breadcrumbs from her <a
href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020173-creamy-cauliflower-pasta-with-pecorino-bread-crumbs">cauliflower
pasta recipe</a>. So, after the mushrooms were crisped, she made
that.</p>
<p>We had a few fall vegetables on hand we thought would be good on the
side: delicata squash and romanesco (or, as I prefer to call it,
“self-similar broccoli”). We decided to roast them while we made the
rest of the meal. Little did we know that the veg would combine with the
pasta and sauce oh so well.</p>
<p>The cream sauce was simple: cream, alliums, and pasta water. We
finished cooking the pasta in the sauce. The rest was a matter of
combining the elements – roasted veggies, pasta with sauce – finished
with fresh-chopped parsley and those cheesy, crispy bread crumbs. We
added a glass of rosé, and called it a night.</p>

<title>Chipping Away Writer’s Block</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/chipping-away-writers-block/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I had a conversation a few weeks ago with my
project manager, <a href="https://github.com/seefeldb">Bernhard
Seefeld</a>, about strategies to combat writer’s block. At the time, I
had been taking longer than I would like to write documentation. I asked
him how he deals with writer’s block. He gave me some great advice,
which I thought was worthy of sharing.</p>
<h2 id="cant-start-a-draft-send-an-email">Can’t start a draft? Send an
email</h2>
<p>A crafty use of psychology: sitting down and <em>writing</em> can
seem like such a drag. Can’t you just briefly <em>explain</em> the idea
to someone? Why not pretend to (or actually) <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/emails/">send someone an email</a> where you
talk about what you’re going to write.</p>
<p>Viola! You have your first draft.</p>
<h2 id="draw-a-diagram-convert-it-to-text">Draw a diagram, convert it to
text</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the linear nature of writing gets in the way of the
expression of your ideas.</p>
<p>People will <em>read</em> your idea from start to finish, but that
often is not the way you <em>think</em> of an idea.</p>
<p>Drawings become your friend: with them, you’re not bound to write any
portion that is uninspired or follow any order. Berni finds that they
help communicate the relationships between ideas.</p>
<p>You reach a full expression of a though faster with diagram than
paragraphs.</p>
<p>Once you’ve mapped your concept into two dimensions, you’ll have an
easier time describing it in text.</p>
<h2 id="modular-storytelling">Modular Storytelling</h2>
<p>Since we had been talking about documentation, Berni introduced me to
the idea of <a
href="https://www.duarte.com/slidedocs/">SlideDocs</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Instead of traditional documents, the medium is slides;
Instead of a presentation, they are used as reference material.</p>
<p>There are a few aspects of SlideDocs that strike me as valuable.
First, I like how each slide covers only one concept. This is helpful
both in the construction and consumption of the deck. The slide is
organized into a format of increasing levels of depth: the title
contains the core idea, diagrams another layer, and small print provides
full information. Then, concepts can be interchanged within the deck in
a modular fashion.</p>
<p>The second thing that I really like about slide decks is that the
format easily flows into a narrative. Since it relies on the more
familiar form factor of a presentation, the writer is more likely to
tell a story. Though ultimately, everything gets read, the creator is
more likely to “speak” to the reader.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not writing documentation, there’s valuable lessons to
gleam from their model. If you organize ideas into bite-sizes units,
writing becomes an exercise of arrangement and filling in the details
(see slide 44 onward). Further, writing becomes easier if you realize
that you are not writing in a vacuum, but communicating to
<em>somebody</em>, down the line.</p>]]></description>

<title>Getting Back My Domain</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/getting-back-my-domain/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well, here’s a very meta story about this
website and how I’ve grown since I started it.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about an issue that has bugged me for quite some time and
the annoying maze I had to get out of to fix it.</p>
<p>Check out the URL of this domain. Is it secure? How do you know? Let
me show you how <em>I</em> know it’s not, as of writing:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/alex-is-not-secure.png"
title="A URL bar with no HTTPS support"
alt="My site does not use HTTPS, and therefore is not secure" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">My site does not use HTTPS, and therefore
is not secure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>“How embarrassing. A software engineer who doesn’t know how to set up
HTTPS for his own personal site.”</p>
<p>When I started this site in 2017, that was the case. At least, I was
focused on getting something up and running quickly, and snoozed on
adding that feature. Like most of software engineering, building things
outside of your current ability is just a matter of Googling it and
following directions.</p>
<p>As time has gone on, I’ve kept postponing this feature, despite <a
href="https://github.blog/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/">learning
how to implement it</a>. I’ve avoided addressing anything to do with my
domain due to a completely avoidable predicament that I got myself into
all in the name of “security”. Here I am today, writing support tickets
to sort it all out.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I was younger, I found this free Chrome extension that would
provide me piece-of-mind while web-browsing. It was called MaskedMe, and
the general idea was it helped you control spam and prevent hacking. It
did this by generating a fake email address per website, and
automatically forwarding all the emails to your real address.</p>
<p>“Great!” I thought. “I can’t be subject to a <a
href="https://xkcd.com/792/">password-reuse attack</a> if every email I
use is different, right?”</p>
<p>It had additional services, totally for free, for replacing phone
numbers and credit cards, so you never had to give up personal
information. So I replaced a lot of information on various accounts with
generated emails, cell phone numbers, and credit cards.</p>
<p>Sometime around the end of high school or early college, after
adopting MaskMe, I thought to myself, “I should buy my personal domain
before <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/public/Alex-Rosengarten">another Alex
Rosengarten</a> beats me to it.”</p>
<p>So I did. But I had the <em>brilliant</em> idea to make the account
holding my domains as anonymous as possible. You know, just in case I
wanted to buy <em>other</em> domains where I would <em>need</em>
anonymity (spoiler: this never happened). I filled out my account
information without my actual email, name, or phone number, but with a
real credit card.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years.</p>
<p>I somehow get into my domain name service (Namecheap) and wire up my
domain to point to Github pages. I set up a quick, custom jekyll blog,
autopay for my domain every year, and never have to log into the domain
name service for any reason.</p>
<p>Fast forward, later still.</p>
<p>I’ve gained maturity as a developer and know my way around cloud
technologies (like GCP and AWS). I’m motivated to consolidate my tools
on to one platform so I can build more advanced things. To this end, I
attempt to log on to Namecheap, which should be easy because I actually
remember my username and password. I enter those pieces of information.
Then, I hit the next screen:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://alxmrs.com/assets/namecheap-mfa-masked.png"
title="A MFA screen showing my MaskedMe phone number"
alt="I have to wait on a text to a phone number I don’t control" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">I have to wait on a text to a phone
number I don’t control</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ok. This is <em>annoying</em>, but not too big of a problem. I’ll
just log into my MaskedMe account, get the multi-factor authentication
(MFA) code, and move along.</p>
<p>A Google search gets me <a href="https://www.abine.com/">here</a>:
Apparently MaskMe has re-branded as Abine, offering two services: Blur
(same services as MaskMe) and DeleteMe, a way to scrub your online
footprint off the web.</p>
<p>“That’s fine”, I thought. “They’ll have all my account information in
tact.”</p>
<p>Spoiler: They didn’t.</p>
<p>Apparently, masked credit cards and phone numbers have become part of
their <em>premium</em> services.</p>
<p>From here, I took several approaches to recover this proxy cell
number. I filed a support ticket (longer wait for free customers). I
called their support phone line (a dead end loop that tells you to email
them). I even tried to sign up for premium – for some reason, my
attempts to upgrade failed every time (likely because my data was stale,
they built their service around new customers instead of maintaining
connections for old ones).</p>
<p>Eventually, I got a hold of Abine support. They said that after a
long enough period of inactivity, they deprecate text message proxies.
This means that there was no way that I could access the MFA number, and
was likely permanently locked out of my Namescheap account.</p>
<p>This sucked a lot. Not only was I unable to maintain, upgrade, or
configure my domain, I risked losing it after my credit card expired and
ceased payments.</p>
<p>The next lever I had left to pull was contacting Namecheap support.
In my first conversation with their live help chat service, I saw a
glimmer of hope: Their customer service members could override MFA
temporarily if I could prove ownership of the account. This glimmer was
extinguished soon, however, when I learned that to identify me, they
needed the phone number on the account.</p>
<p>With nothing left to do, I filed a ticket at their risk management
team, hoping that they could help me. If that failed, my hail mary
option was to modify the content of my website, proving that it was
really me after all.</p>
<p>A day later, they got back to me. Without the phone number, they
could do nothing for me.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have not missed the great, dual irony of the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used a series of indirections to remain anonymous… to publicize
myself on the internet.</li>
<li>The security measures I took… made me more vulnerable and less in
control.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Congratulations,” <a href="http://camille.merose.com">my partner</a>
told me. “You played yourself.”</p>
<p>Thanks, hun.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, I searched my email and other records for
traces of that number with no success. I knew that this was a futile
effort, but I did it anyway out of desperation.</p>
<p>Then, I had an idea. When I originally created my account, I paid for
extra services to make sure that any identifying data about the domain
wouldn’t be publicly listed. I decided to check that anyway, just in
case.</p>
<p>I ran a query via Whois.org –</p>
<p>“There it is!” I discovered.</p>
<p>Apparently, I had only paid for a year’s worth of this service. It
had expired long ago. But there it was, a phone number ending in
<code>057</code>.</p>
<p>Soon after, I had another live chat with Namecheap customer support.
Before I knew it, I bypassed the MFA.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my younger days, I had an unbalanced sense of trust. I had strong
feelings towards protecting myself online, but no context to correctly
model risk. At the time, I didn’t know of the importance of certain
choices – like how <a href="https://doesmysiteneedhttps.com/">important
HTTPS is for web browsing</a>. I also neglected to consider the
longevity of other choices. I needed to ask myself, “how dependable are
the tools I choose to rely on?”</p>
<p>Further, this situation could have been avoided if I performed
regular maintenance. The logic I practiced was akin to the idea that you
can’t fall victim to a phishing attack if you never check email. Or, it
was always tomorrow Alex’s problem. Now that I’m in a less turbulent
time in my life, I can work on minimizing my digital footprint and
tending to my virtual garden.</p>
<p>In addition to risk assessment and orderliness, this experience has
been a great lesson in skepticism. Before, I thought I needed to be
robust against human adversaries. As I’ve matured, it’s clear that I
need to be robust against human error.</p>]]></description>

<title>In Defense of Interruptions</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Many believe that the <a
href="https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/">global
minimum number of interruptions</a> is good for software development. I
disagree. Interruptions are inevitable and often useful.</p>
<h2 id="interruption-is-a-slur-for-collaboration">“Interruption” Is A
Slur For Collaboration</h2>
<p>Interruptions are inevitable. In typical agile shops, there are
stand-ups, sprint-plannings, retrospectives, and other corporate
meetings. Communication takes place on Slack, HipChat, and the like. To
butcher Kurt Vonnegut, being anti-interruptions “is like being
anti-glacier.”</p>
<p>But, are interruptions all bad? No!</p>
<p>In fact, in the cases listed here, they are merely the realities in
working in a collaborative environment <sup id="a1"><a
href="#f1">1</a></sup>. Can we not lend 15 minutes to perform a code
review for a colleague? Should we skip answering a question from an
intern because it would interrupt our current work?</p>
<p>Even if meetings are a drag<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> and
you don’t have any of the aforementioned, would you permit being
interrupted for a <code>P0</code> bug? Of course!</p>
<p>I think we should celebrate interruptions rather than demonize them.
Yes, retrospectives are valuable even though I haven’t finished my
current story. Of course, I will teach you about mime types, rising
sophomore intern, instead of just using the term in context. Give me a
minutes to finish what I’m typing<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>,
but then <em>yes</em>, I’ll review your PR.</p>

<title>Higher Order Functions on Pandas Dataframes</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<guid>https://alex.merose.com/higher-order-functions-on-pandas-dataframes/</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>(Note: the following article is unedited –
Proceed with caution).</p>
<p>(Last updated: 2018-07-31)</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I wrote this article to capture a perspective on dataframes that I
think most Python developers – especially data scientists –
overlook.</p>
<p>Working closely with data often lends itself to tight coupling to the
structure of that data. With this comes messy, brittle code.</p>
<p>I contend that there is a better way; a way that promotes modular,
flexible, and testable code; a method where we can automate away the
boring parts and think clearly about the problem at hand.</p>
<p>The core idea is to promote re-use of logic through composition. To
this end, we treat functions as data. We must also try as much as
possible to abstract away the nonessential details of each
operation.</p>
<p>I’m getting ahead of myself. It’s better to <em>show</em> rather than
<em>tell</em>. Let’s explore the thought process of refactoring the
standard method for querying data in Pandas.</p>
<h2 id="the-conventional-way">The Conventional Way</h2>
<p>The Pandas documentation explains the similarities between their API
and SQL for querying tabular data. A SQL query with a compound
<code>WHERE</code> clause, for instance, can be expressed as
follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">-- tips of more than $5.00 at Dinner meals</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">SELECT</span> <span class="op">*</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">FROM</span> tips</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">WHERE</span> <span class="dt">time</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&#39;Dinner&#39;</span> <span class="kw">AND</span> tip <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fl">5.00</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent Pandas syntax is as such:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># tips of more than $5.00 at Dinner meals</span></span>

<p><a
href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_sql.html#where">(source)</a></p>
<p>What if we wanted to extend our query with an arbitrary number of
conditions?</p>
<p>Using the standard Pandas syntax, it would look something like
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> tips[(tips[<span class="st">&#39;time&#39;</span>] <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&#39;Dinner&#39;</span>) <span class="op">&amp;</span> (tips[<span class="st">&#39;tip&#39;</span>] <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fl">5.00</span>) <span class="op">&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>...      (tips[<span class="st">&#39;sex&#39;</span>] <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&#39;Female&#39;</span>)  <span class="op">&amp;</span> (tips[<span class="st">&#39;smoker&#39;</span>] <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&#39;No&#39;</span>)]</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>     total_bill   tip     sex smoker  day    time  size</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">52</span>        <span class="fl">34.81</span>  <span class="fl">5.20</span>  Female     No  Sun  Dinner     <span class="dv">4</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">155</span>       <span class="fl">29.85</span>  <span class="fl">5.14</span>  Female     No  Sun  Dinner     <span class="dv">5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This does not seem ideal. Our line of code quickly gets longer as we
add more filtering logic. A lot of logic is repeated – namely, we keep
referring to the <code>tips</code> dataframe over and over. What if the
dataframe name changed? Or we wanted to apply the same query to another,
similar table?</p>
<p>This would double our work: We would need to re-write the whole line
substituting one variable name for the other. Or worse, we could swap
the data each variable refers to.</p>
<p>How can we provide a more succinct interface for querying data? How
can we make sure that it is intuitive, general, and correct?</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-problem">Breaking Down The Problem</h2>
<p>Let’s break down what’s going on in the above query:</p>

<p>Ah! So what’s actually going on is we are taking advantage of
dataframe’s capacity for <a
href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html#boolean-indexing">boolean
indexing</a>.</p>
<p>What if we could use this to abstract away which dataframe we are
acting on? Certainly, we’d prefer to only focus on the filtering logic
rather than housekeeping. Plus, we might like to reuse the query on
different dataframes.</p>
<p>Let’s try this:</p>

<p>Great. I now have two functions <code>is_dinner_time</code> and
<code>is_tip_above_five</code> which I could use on any other dataframe.
However, I still am repeating the reference to <code>tips</code> as many
times as I did before. How can I get rid of this grunt work? Ideally, I
would like to refer to a dataframe once, mixing in the filter operations
and I see fit.</p>
<h2 id="towards-generalization">Towards Generalization</h2>
<p>Why not use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order
function</a>? Functions are first class citizens in python, after all.
Let’s abstract away the rote work of calling these filter functions with
respect to a particular dataframe.</p>

<p>Much better. Now, should we want to add additional fields in the
table to filter with, we merely define more filter functions – which,
again, can be used for any table.</p>
<p>Please note that each functions can be as complicated as we want, as
long as they return a dataframe of booleans the same size as the
input.</p>
<p>For example, if we are querying string data that is messy, we could
write a filter like the following:</p>

<p>Sure, we could have implemented the <code>union</code> and
<code>intersection</code> cases by themselves, but the function
<code>filter_reduce</code> offers us the luxury of adaptability later
on.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-querying">Beyond Querying</h2>
<p>Can this perspective help with other problems besides querying?</p>
<p>Often, we need to mutate dataframes. We might want to add a column of
derived values, or change a column’s data type. Mutability, however,
comes with several challenges: What if we make a mistake when mutating
the dataframe, and we would like to revert to the previous form? What if
we wanted to know what the original data looked like?</p>
<p>In Pandas, we can simulate immutability by creating mapping functions
that first perform a shallow copy of the input dataframe and return a
new result.</p>

<p>One advantage of this approach is that mutating dataframes can be
lazily evaluated: We can wait to modify the data only until it’s needed
(i.e. until we call <code>compose</code>).</p>
<p>Another advantage is that we preserve all the intermediate states of
the data. Further, we have complete flexibility as to what mappings get
applied. Decide that we want to keep the <code>smokers</code> column as
strings again? – Just remove the <code>yesno_to_bool</code> function.
Decide that you’d rather map it to <code>int</code>s? – Simply swap out
the function. Just like the filter functions, these mappers can be
applied to any dataframe, provided they have the correct columns.</p>
<p>It’s worth wondering: Is copying all of the data inefficient? Surely,
we don’t want to duplicate the data all over the place, especially if
the corpus is large.</p>
<p>Pandas addresses this in a very clever manner. The constructor
performs a lazy copy! The copied dataframes store references to the
original values. Only when the data gets mutated does it decide to
allocate new memory. In other words, only the <em>differences</em> from
one dataframe to another are stored. Thus, representing transformations
with copies remains efficient while promoting many other benefits.</p>
<p>Don’t take my word for it! Let’s prove that this is the case:</p>

<title>Thoughts About Cognitive Ecology</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h2 id="where-is-the-mind">Where is the Mind?</h2>
<p>One the first day of Distributed Cognition, COGS 102a at UCSD,
Professor Johnson hands out a piece of paper for every pair of students
in a 400 person auditorium. On the back of the sheet is a maze, which
cannot be solved until the class has heard her instructions.</p>
<p>We all turn to our right or left and team up with our neighbor, as
per the instructions. One person in the team is allowed to put a pen to
the start of the maze. However, this person must have his or her eyes
closed thereafter. The other person is allowed to see the maze and
communicate instructions to the effector team member, but cannot
physically intervene in any way.</p>
<p>The time begins, every team flips their paper, and over the next
three minutes the class is full voices commanding “Up – right! No, too
far!” and the like.</p>
<p>At the end of the exercise, Professor Johnson proposes a question:
Where is the mind that got through the maze?</p>
<p>The class thinks this over for a minute before a few students raise
their hands.</p>
<p>“It had to have been the students providing instructions,” one
student argues, “For they perceived the maze, understood it, and planned
a navigation strategy.”</p>
<p>Another student counters: “No, the mind belongs with the students who
had a pen to the maze. They had to interpret and embody the instructions
they received.”</p>
<p>After a little more discussion, the class waits for a definitive
answer from Professor Johnson.</p>
<p>She explained, “The mind that got through the maze is a
<em>system</em> that includes both people, the pen, and the maze.”</p>
<p>And with this moment, my perspective about the nature of
consciousness forever changed.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m taking a class called neural encoding of
sensory systems and it make me appreciate the complexity and elegance of
the brain so much more than I have ever before. I wish that I had the
time to take all the neuroscience classes and ECE classes and their
per-requisites so that I could better understand the underlying
machinery of the human (primate) brain.</p>
<p>The globular bushy cells, for instance, have the biggest axon
diameters of all the neurons in the auditory system.<br />
They need to be so thick because they need to transmit signals fast –
from the cochlea (where hair cells transduce mechanical sound into
electric signals) to a nucleus all the way on the opposite
(contralateral) side of the brain. This takes a few hundred
microseconds, quick enough so that the fibers connecting the cochlea
from the same (ipsilateral) side of the brain only have time to fire one
action potential on to that nucleus.</p>
<p>I read an article about a team of bioengineers at Stanford creating
microchips that simulated 10,000 neurons. I feel like I could join them
if I had the chance to take computational neurobiology or semiconductor
physics – or both. If I every get a masters, I’ll be sure to take those
classes… if that’s still something that I want to do when I get
there.</p>]]></description>

<title>Film in the Era of Google Glass</title>
<pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Ubiquitous technologies have already enabled us
to capture events that were never possible before. Not too long ago, one
could only see photographs and movies about the aftermath of meteorites,
plane crashes, explosions, revolutions, and the like. Camera-equipped
smartphone have made it possible to capture catastrophic events in real
time, enabling us to record history as it is happening.</p>
<p>When Google Glass becomes widely used, I expect this phenomena to
proliferate. Constant surveillance would be a casual thing. This faction
of humanity will become living cameras with names and social security
numbers. They will fight to be the first to witness and upload some
object of history, to proudly regard themselves as part of the great
peripheral system in the embodied internet.</p>
<p>Granted, a great deal of this is happening now. Google Glass,
however, seems to be a purer expression of a new trend of consumer
cybernetics. The next step after pushing augmented reality from nuance
to normalcy, in my opinion, will be incorporating biofeedback as a
causal control system.</p>
<p>What peeks my interest the most about this emerging technology is the
potential for revolutionizing art and film. Augmented reality glasses,
such as Google Glass, will usher in a new era of experimental,
independent film.</p>
<p>What if, for instance, a film had no pre-written script, director, or
editor? Instead, just costumes, props, a setting, and highly skilled
long-form improvisors, each equipped with Google Glasses. They could
reenact scenes from history or fantasy in whatever genre of their
choosing. Protagonists would not even be chosen ahead of time: Actors
would be told that there are no lead and non-lead roles; every character
is as important as you make them. Acting troupes would be valued for
their ability to imagine and implement stories as a team.</p>
<p>Director/editors would be granted permission to access the vast
amount of raw footage generated by each actor, no matter how important
or significant they ended up being. The artfulness of the movie would
not only come from the brilliance of the actors, but also from the
director/editors ability to choose the organic narratives generated from
the days of filming. Key to this technique would be the art of
selection.</p>
<p>A single film could produce enough data that teams of
editor/directors could create multiple films, each telling a separate
narrative that relates yet is independent of the others. For instance, a
team of college students could produce an independent, “open-source”
film contest, where they supply the footage of actors performing, lets
say, a murder-mystery. The job of competing editors would be to put the
film together in the most artful way.</p>
<p>This sort of application of Google Glass, to me, would combine data
science and art. There would be so much film that humans might have to
work along algorithms to find the salient aspects of a story across
multiple cameras. The story would have to be pieced together by
software-engineer artists, experts in data compression and design,
neural nets and narrative.</p>]]></description>
