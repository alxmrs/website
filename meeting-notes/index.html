<h1 class="title">Taking Meeting Notes: Humans vs AI</h1>

<p>I took the notes in a meeting today<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Sometimes I get complements on how I take notes. Today, though, I got an
unusual one: In the middle of a discussion that I was capturing, someone
paused and asked, "Is this an AI note-taking services? I don't think so
because it's making spelling mistakes." I looked up from my keyboard a
bit surprised, bearing a smile.</p>
<p>It made me think a bit about the differences between how humans and
AIs take notes. One reason why she may have thought that I was an AI is
that I've gotten really good at simultaneously transcribing and
summarizing ideas ‚Äì mostly, from my previous life as a high school
debater. I think this <em>is</em> something that an AI note-taking
service could reasonably learn to do, though I don't know of a service
that does this today. Doing so lets me keep up to pace with the
conversation as it's happening. Passing a reverse Turing Test for
note-taking is definitely a skill that one can learn with practice ‚Äì
especially, when practiced on a spreading<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
opponent in a debate. (A related useful skill is being able to write
notes like this while simultaneously thinking of things to say ‚Äì a
subject for another time.)</p>
<p>There's an aspect of this style of note-taking that I think would be
non-trivial to replicate in an any AI-powered system ‚Äì¬†a feature that
might seem totally trivial: That is, I know when and where to add the
right indentations. The ability to organize threads hierarchically yet
faithfully in a conversation should be quite difficult for an automated
system. It requires a decent context of not only what is being said, but
how it relates to concepts mentioned in and <em>out</em> of the
conversation. Maybe this would require a decent world model<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> or reasoning capabilities; I'm not
totally sure. The AI note-taking systems I've seen that approximate such
a feature seem to require human collaboration.</p>
<p>It reminds me of what a teacher once said on social media about the
ChatGPT-generated homework of her students: it's writing full of
mediocre ideas with perfect grammar and spelling. AI notes may provide
perfect transcriptions and clean auto-generated summaries, but they are
mediocre at what I like to use meetings for: as a medium that lets me
forget<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
