<h1 class="title">How I chose an engagement ring</h1>
<p class="date">2021-04-21</p>
</header>
<p>When I first started looking for a ring, I was looking at how much
bang for my buck I could get in diamond sizes... which was totally the
wrong way to go about it. Cam wouldn't want a big rock on an ugly ring
-- it would get in the way and be a liability! Besides, the ring had to
compliment her style and personality.</p>
<p>The trick that worked for me to better figure out what would best
suit her was to talk <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/briannabanananana/">to</a> <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/sleepiegirl/">her</a> <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/ro.riches/">friends</a> . I ended up
starting a group chat with a few of her closest gals to gather intel.
Turns out that they regularly would share what kinds of jewelry / rings
that they liked. In any case, they had a much better idea of where to
start looking than I did.</p>
<p>For Cam, I knew that I wanted to get an environmentally friendly,
conflict-free diamond. I thought I would go towards the lab-grown
variety. However, her friends pointed me towards place like <a
href="https://fiatluxsf.com/">Fiat Lux</a> , <a
href="http://www.anastassiasel.com/">Anastassia Sel Jewelry</a>, <a
href="https://www.asraigarden.com/">asrai garden</a>, and <a
href="https://sofiazakia.com/">Sofia Zakia</a>. Not only do these
jewelers only source ethical stones, they also fit Camille's style.</p>
<p>Here's a general overview of how ordering a ring went down.</p>
<ul>
<li>FiatLux was based in San Francisco and located a quick BART ride
away from my office.</li>
<li>Visited them for the first time w/ <a
href="https://eatbigger.fish/">eve</a>. This was early October.</li>
<li>Met <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thee.georgie/">Georgie</a>,
who was awesome and would help me find the perfect ring.</li>
<li>Narrowed down various styles of rings while outlining which type of
stone to get.</li>
<li>From a (much) earlier convo with Camille, I knew that she liked
grey, imperfect diamonds.</li>
<li>I said that I wanted a hexagonal stone, and a ring to match.</li>
<li>Later, Georgie would find three stones; the middle one had the
greatest color in the light.</li>
<li>At thanksgiving without Camille, I couldn't keep in my excitement
and blurted that I was ring shopping to my family. I showed them the
options I had. My Aunti <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/roz_creativestylist/">Rasmit</a> said
that I should go with the biggest stone.</li>
<li>I went with my gut and chose the middle-sized stone that was
elongated and had a beautiful shimmer. I also paired it with a <a
href="https://fiatluxsf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3595-W.png">Casia
Vestra</a>.</li>
<li>Once I decided, it was time to wait. I ordered the ring around late
November, with general plans to propose at the beginning of the new
year.</li>
<li>Turns out there is a holiday rush to make rings in time for end of
year proposals! That's ok, by then, I changed my plans to pop the
question before Valentines day. The ring should be ready by then,
right?</li>
<li>Turns out the holiday rush can quickly turn into the Valentines' day
rush. There were fewer and fewer days in my 10-day period to pop the
question, and the ring was still not ready. The weekend before our
Valentines day trip was not available to me to have a spontaneous
proposal, because Cam was enrolled in a wilderness medicine orientation
and would be busy the whole time!</li>
<li>The ring came, like, one week before my trip, on a Wednesday. It was
just in time for me to propose the way I wanted to. I had the wiggle
room of two days to <a
href="https://alxmrs.com/proposal/">propose</a>.</li>
