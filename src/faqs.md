<summary>What do you do for work?</summary>

<div id="work"></div>

I'm not working at the moment! However, I used to work at Google Research. There, I developed machine-learning
applications for the weather. A lot of the time this involves making
[weather data easier to work with](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/), if
not [specific datasets](https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5). If you've Googled the weather and saw a bar that
told you how soon it was going to rain, you've used
my [old team's main product](https://blog.research.google/2023/11/metnet-3-state-of-art-neural-weather.html). Before
this, I used to work on the [Arcs project](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs), a system to protect user privacy in the
AI era. I've been lucky so far that a lot of my work involves contributing to [open source](https://github.com/alxmrs).
Before joining Google, I've had
a [mix of software engineering and machine learning roles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/almerose/).

<summary>Where are you from?</summary>

<div id="from"></div>

All over California, really. I grew up in [San Diego](/zettel/san-diego/) (north county) and went to college there, too.
I lived in Oakland for a few years, then in the Santa Cruz / Monterey area. During the pandemic, I found myself in the
central coast near SLO. Hey, maybe one day I'll end up in Chico or Mt. Shasta.

<summary>What kinds of things do you do for fun?</summary>

<div id="fun"></div>

I used to fret this question. Especially its corollary: "What are your hobbies?" For the longest time, I felt like I had
no hobbies, despite my best intentions at starting playing music or [creating art](/electric-origami/). There never
seemed to be any time. Then, one day, my father-in-law dropped a bomb on me: Travelling is my hobby. Until he said it,
it never clicked that time spent planning, packing, and unpacking for trips amounted to something!

I really enjoy traveling. I definitely got the travel bug while coming of age. I visited my (then) college girlfriend
while she studied abroad in New Zealand. On this first major international trip as an adult, I saw NZ (north island
only) and Tonga. We've used to do at least one major trip per year once we started working, as folks do. I once took a
wonderful family trip to Havana, Cuba – we snuck that in during the brief window when it was allowed for Americans!
When I got my last job, I started traveling internationally for work (primarily to Sydney), which only gave me more of
an apptetite to see more places.

Cam & I took a break from this, of course, during the pandemic. When travel became safer, we started to explore
domestically. We moved [all around California](#from) and visited friends & family around North America. We would jump
to new places even with the flimsiest of excuses.

Right now (most likely, who has time to update FAQ pages?), Cam and I are on a yearlong trip around the world. We quit
our jobs on Friday the 13th of October 2023, to finally see the world to our heart's desire. You can read about where we
went or hear about where we're going to be on our [newsletter](https://vagabonvivants.substack.com/).

<summary>What kind of music do you like? What have you been listening to recently?</summary>

<div id="music"></div>

Why, thank you for asking! In a world of streaming music, it's common to say that one's tastes are eclectic. This
certainly is true for me, however, it doesn't really speak to the shape of my preferences. Let me show rather than tell
what I like (with the help of [everynoise.com](https://everynoise.com)):

* [Here are all my playlists](https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=spotify:user:djbokonon). I've been
  cataloguing all the songs I encounter, saving the ones that are new-to-me in lists organized by month & year (since ~
  2016).

* Try clicking on the "tracks" link for a playlist. For
  example, [here are the tracks](https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=2h0gMiVpHTnEdgk905lCSR) in my
  `2022 jan` playlist.

* If a genre seems interesting to you, click the link to explore artists that create music associated with that genre.
  For example, I listen to a bunch of [art pop](https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=genre&name=art%20pop).

<summary>Neat website. How's it made?</summary>

Thanks! This website is mostly generated HTML and CSS. In an effort to keep things simple, my generator consists of some
shell scripts that invoke [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (Check out the [source](https://github.com/alxmrs/website), or
consider [making your own](https://github.com/alxmrs/pandoc-website-template) shell-powered website). I thought I would
have to replace my hacked-together solution with a "real" static site generator until I
found [this awesome project](https://github.com/chambln/pandoc-rss) for generating an RSS feed! It seems like I'm not
the only pandoc obsessed developer out there (there are dozens of us!). I guess the allure of creating a website in
PowerPoint too strong to let this go...

If you find any part of it that is not accessible or generally unusable, please reach out to me, and I'll correct it.

<summary>Do you have any advice for becoming a software engineer?</summary>

Yes – but that depends a lot on your situation. Please, email me (or reach out some other way). I'm happy to give you my
2¢.

<summary>I'm a UCSD undergraduate.</summary>

Awesome. I get messages from UCSD undergrads from time to time. One day, I'll write an article with general advice for
students like you. Until then, would you be interested
in [connecting with me on TritonsConnect](https://tritonsconnect.com/user/782505)? From there, I can learn a bit more
about you and provide commensurate advice.
