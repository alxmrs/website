<summary>What do you do for work?</summary>

I work at Google Research on the Anthromet team. Here, I develop machine-learning applications for the weather. I used
to work on the [Arcs project](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs), a system to protect user privacy in the AI era.
Before joining Google, I've had
a [mix of software engineering and machine learning roles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/almerose/).

<summary>Where are you from?</summary>

<div id="from"></div>

All over California, really. I grew up in [San Diego](/zettel/san-diego/) (north county) and went to college there, too.
I lived in Oakland for a few years, then in the Santa Cruz / Monterey area. During the pandemic, I found myself in the
central coast near SLO. Hey, maybe one day I'll end up in Chico or Mt. Shasta.

<summary>What kinds of things do you do for fun?</summary>

<div id="fun"></div>

I used to fret this question. Especially its corollary: "What are your hobbies?" For the longest time, I felt like
I had no hobbies, despite my best intentions at starting playing music or [creating art](/electric-origami/). There
never seemed to be any time. Then, one day, my father-in-law dropped a bomb on me: Travelling is my hobby. Until he said
it, it never clicked that time spent planning, packing, and unpacking for trips amounted to something!

I really enjoy traveling. I definitely got the travel bug while coming of age. I visited my (then) college girlfriend
while she studied abroad in New Zealand. On this first major international trip without my family, I saw NZ's north
island and the island nation of Tonga. Since graduating, I've had the pleasure of visiting several places in Europe.
I took a wonderful family trip to Havana, Cuba – we snuck that in during the brief window when it was allowed! I got
more comfortable with international travel when I joined Google. My first team there was primarily based on two cities:
SF and Sydney. So, I got to travel to Aus twice a year for work. In fact, my first week on the job after orientation, my
team flew me to Sydney! I was slowly but surely building up more competence in travel, which begets an appetite to see
more places.

Cam & I took a break from this during the height of the pandemic. When travel became safer, we started to take
excursions domestically. We moved [all around California](#from) and visited friends & family in the East Coast and
Texas. To this day, we always seem to have an upcoming place to visit.

Underscoring all of this, I'd say that what I value most of all is being part of a community. I like to see family &
friends whenever possible, even if this means going across state or country. I also like to make friends out of
strangers — I once made a friend on Bart!

<summary>What kind of music do you like? What have you been listening to recently?</summary>

<div id="music"></div>

Why, thank you for asking! In a world of streaming music, it's common to say that one's tastes are eclectic. This
certainly is true for me, however, it doesn't really speak to the shape of my preferences. Let me show rather than tell
what I like (with the help of [everynoise.com](https://everynoise.com)):

* [Here are all my playlists](https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=user&name=djbokonon). I've been cataloguing all
  the songs I encounter, saving the ones that are new-to-me in lists organized by month & year (since ~2016).

* Try clicking on the "tracks" link for a playlist. For
  example, [here are the tracks](https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=1UcLLHgGUDe8lBOuuuiN1Y) in my
  `Spring Refined 2016` playlist. Or, consider
  viewing [the tracks of a more recent playlist](https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=2NDxw8EduMlWC73ZSOJ21X).
  These will give you a feel of the music and subgenres that I like.

* If a genre seems interesting to you, click the link to explore artists that create music associated with that genre.
  For example, I listen to a bunch of [art pop](https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=genre&name=art%20pop).

<summary>Neat website. How's it made?</summary>

Thanks! This website is mostly generated HTML and CSS. In an effort to keep
things simple, my generator consists of some shell scripts that invoke [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (Check out
the [source](https://github.com/alxmrs/website), or
consider [making your own](https://github.com/alxmrs/pandoc-website-template) shell-powered website). I thought I would
have to replace my hacked-together solution with a "real" static site generator until I
found [this awesome project](https://github.com/chambln/pandoc-rss) for generating an RSS feed! It seems like I'm
not the only pandoc obsessed developer out there (there are dozens of us!). I guess the allure of creating a website in
PowerPoint too strong to let this go...

If you find any part of it that is not accessible or generally unusable, please reach out to me, and I'll correct it.

<summary>Do you have any advice for becoming a software engineer?</summary>

Yes – but that depends a lot on your situation. Please, email me (or reach out some other way). I'm happy to give you my
2¢.

<summary>I'm a UCSD undergraduate.</summary>

Awesome. I get messages from UCSD undergrads from time to time. One day, I'll write an article with general advice for
students like you. Until then, would you be interested
in [connecting with me on TritonsConnect](https://tritonsconnect.com/user/782505)? From there, I can learn a bit more
about you and provide commensurate advice.
