title: CSSA ML Workshop: Machine Learning on the Edge
date: 2021-04-05
---

The student org I used to be a part of (the 
[Cognitive Science Student Association](https://cssa-ucsd.org/))
asked me to lead a workshop on machine learning at their
[annual conference](https://cssa-ucsd.github.io/conference2021).
The following are the slides and tutorial I presented. 
Most of my talk consisted of live coding a simple ML application
in the browser using tensorflowjs and glitch.

Together, we made a [mock version](https://insidious-sticky-tank.glitch.me/)
of ["Rainforest Connection"](https://rfcx.org/), an app 
that's fighting climate change and protecting rainforests 
through mobile audio classification.
