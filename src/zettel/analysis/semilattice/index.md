# [Semilattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice)

A semilattice is like a directed [lattice](/zettel/analysis/lattice/) in either
the _meet_ (LCM) or _join_ (GCD) direction ("for _any_ nonempty finite subset").

_Meet_-semilattices are "lower semilattices" whereas _join_-semilattices are "upper
semilattices."

> A set S partially ordered by the binary relation â‰¤ is a meet-semilattice if
>>  For all elements x and y of S, the greatest lower bound of the set {x, y} exists.

Sometimes, we can think of semilattices as being [complete](/zettel/analysis/semilattice/complete/)
(kinda).
