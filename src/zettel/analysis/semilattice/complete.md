# [Complete Semilattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice#Complete_semilattices)

Apparently, this term doesn't mean much. Why? Well, if a 
[semilattice](/zettel/analysis/semilattice/) is complete (all subsets hold the 
meet / join property), then it will be complete in the other direction, making 
it a [complete](/zettel/analysis/lattice/complete/) 
[lattice](/zettel/analysis/lattice/):

> [A] complete meet-semilattice has all non-empty meets (which is equivalent to 
> being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a
> greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. 

Why does this term exist? Probably, because we only care about completeness for
one operation, either just the _meet_ or just the _join_.
