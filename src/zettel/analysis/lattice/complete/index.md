# [Complete Lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)#Completeness)

A [lattice](/zettel/analysis/lattice/) is complete if _all_ subsets have both a 
join and a meet. A complete lattice is more restrictive than a normal lattice.

Every non-empty finite lattice is complete.

[Examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice#Examples):

> The power set of a given set, ordered by inclusion. The supremum is given by 
> the union and the infimum by the intersection of subsets.
>
> ...
>
> The convex subsets of a real or complex vector space, ordered by inclusion. 
> The infimum is given by the intersection of convex sets and the supremum by 
> the convex hull of the union.
