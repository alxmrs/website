# Goal Setting

In 2016, the year I graduated from college,
[my partner, Camille,](https://camillemerz.com) gave me 
a [Passion Planner](https://passionplanner.com).

This planner is a journal / ideation system
that helps you figure out what you want in life, and
then helps you realize it. A guide designed by
someone who felt adrift after her own graduation, it
was exactly what I needed. 

The [system](https://passionplanner.com/products/passion-roadmap) works
something like this: First, you brainstorm ways how you would like to 
change your life (or what you'd like to accomplish). Then, you organize
your top goals per various time spans (lifetime, 3 years, 1 year, 3 
months). Lastly, you break down the goals into a specific _plan of action_,
where you get to hold yourself accountable. This plan of action involves
literally scheduling milestones, reminders, and due dates in the rest of
the book (it's a planner, after all).

I have to admit, the _planner_ part of "Passion Planner"
never stuck for me. I don't really keep track of my
time or tasks on paper; I prefer to use digital calendars and
reminder systems. However, the model of this book has given me a great
sense of structure for my life.  It involves making monthly check-ins, 
to see if your actions are aligning with your goals. In addition, I have a larger check-in at
the end of the year, to contemplate annual progress and cast new goals. 

The process gives me the opportunity to reflect on the [shape of my life](/zettel/determinism).
It feels great to accomplish a goal I've set. 
Better still: it's a real joy to see how your goals change over time.
