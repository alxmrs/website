[Pointed Sets](https://planetmath.org/pointedset)

**Definition**: `(A, a)` is a pointed set if `A` is a set, and `a` is an element of that set. `(.)` implies an ordered pair.

> Pointed sets are mainly used as illustrative examples in the study of universal algebra as algebras with a single constant operator. This operator takes every element in the algebra to a unique constant, which is clearly the basepoint in our definition above.

Pointed sets seem like useful tools in the style of [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).
The let us describe mathematical _operations_ as numbers.
