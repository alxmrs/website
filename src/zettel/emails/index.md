# Emails to Self

Tip: For better work-life balance, consider sending
emails to your self. 

Separate your work and personal apps across devices.
Don't always be available to receive work messages â€“
when you close your laptop, work should be done. 

The hardest part of this separation, for me, is that
shutting a laptop doesn't stop the spontaneous flow
of ideas. Maybe when your [brain is trying to relax](/zettel/boredom), 
you think of a small TODO that will make tomorrow 
better. Or, you feel inspired to create something 
work related. Maybe you've encountered an article in
your feeds that you'd like to share with a co-worker.

Just send the thought from your personal to your work
email. It'll be waiting for you in your inbox
tomorrow. Thereafter, you can resume your non-working 
life.
