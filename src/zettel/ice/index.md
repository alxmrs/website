# A new meditation

_2021-03-13_

A new meditation: 

Let ice melt on your tongue. 

Feel the cold on your palate. 

Pain centers you on the moment.

Notice the nervous impulse to chew.

Notice when you are chewing, when you

were otherwise lost in a thought. 

Return to the breath. To the chill. 

Savor the present.
