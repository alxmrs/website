# 15 minutes of boredom a day

_2021-01-01_

A week ago (late 2020), [I started a new habit](/zettel/goals/): 
I now try to find 15 minutes of boredom a day. 

These are uninterrupted periods of no stimulation.
I have my phone off or in another room. 
I avoid screens in general. No music plays in the 
background. I just sit there alone with my thoughts
and perceptions â€“ preferably outside.

I find my 15 minutes to be exhilarating. They start 
out... boring. Soon enough, my mind will wonder and
I'll enjoy following its path. 

I'll sing the earworm stuck in my head while thinking
about the next revision of the [hex
tile art](https://editor.p5js.org/alxrsngrtn/sketches/8Ndif6Ngl)
I'm working on. I'll dig into a [joke my wife made
about me](/zettel/determinism/) and reflect on what 
it means. I'll think of articles I want to write.
I'll think about thinking. 

Whereas [meditation](/zettel/ice/) focuses on the absence of 
thought in favor of presence, 15 minutes of boredom helps me
form ideas. I find the ritual to be refreshing even
when I bear no new thoughts. I relish the opportunity
for peace and emotional reflection.
