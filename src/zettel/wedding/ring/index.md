# How I chose an engagement ring

_2021-04_

When I first started looking for a ring, I was looking at how much bang for my buck I could get in diamond sizes...
which was totally the wrong way to go about it. Cam wouldn't want a big rock on an ugly ring -- it would get in the way
and be a liability! Besides, the ring had to compliment her style and personality.

The trick that worked for me to better figure out what would best suit her was to
talk [to](https://www.instagram.com/briannabanananana/) [her](https://www.instagram.com/sleepiegirl/) [friends](https://www.instagram.com/ro.riches/)
. I ended up starting a group chat with a few of her closest gals to gather intel. Turns out that they regularly would
share what kinds of jewelry / rings that they liked. In any case, they had a much better idea of where to start looking
than I did.

For Cam, I knew that I wanted to get an environmentally friendly, conflict-free diamond. I thought I would go towards
the lab-grown variety. However, her friends pointed me towards place like [Fiat Lux](https://fiatluxsf.com/)
, [Anastassia Sel Jewelry](http://www.anastassiasel.com/), [asrai garden](https://www.asraigarden.com/),
and [Sofia Zakia](https://sofiazakia.com/). Not only do these jewelers only source ethical stones, they also fit
Camille's style.

Here's a general overview of how ordering a ring went down.

- FiatLux was based in San Francisco and located a quick BART ride away from my office.
- Visited them for the first time w/ [eve](https://eatbigger.fish/). This was early October.
- Met [Georgie](https://www.instagram.com/thee.georgie/), who was awesome and would help me find the perfect ring.
- Narrowed down various styles of rings while outlining which type of stone to get.
- From a (much) earlier convo with Camille, I knew that she liked grey, imperfect diamonds.
- I said that I wanted a hexagonal stone, and a ring to match.
- Later, Georgie would find three stones; the middle one had the greatest color in the light.
- At thanksgiving without Camille, I couldn't keep in my excitement and blurted that I was ring shopping to my family. I
  showed them the options I had. My Aunti [Rasmit](https://www.instagram.com/roz_creativestylist/) said that I should go
  with the biggest stone.
- I went with my gut and chose the middle-sized stone that was elongated and had a beautiful shimmer. I also paired it
  with a [Casia Vestra](https://fiatluxsf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3595-W.jpg).
- Once I decided, it was time to wait. I ordered the ring around late November, with general plans to propose at the
  beginning of the new year.
- Turns out there is a holiday rush to make rings in time for end of year proposals! That's ok, by then, I changed my
  plans to pop the question before Valentines day. The ring should be ready by then, right?
- Turns out the holiday rush can quickly turn into the Valentines' day rush. There were fewer and fewer days in my
  10-day period to pop the question, and the ring was still not ready. The weekend before our Valentines day trip was
  not available to me to have a spontaneous proposal, because Cam was enrolled in a wilderness medicine orientation and
  would be busy the whole time!
- The ring came, like, one week before my trip, on a Wednesday. It was just in time for me to propose the way I wanted
  to. I had the wiggle room of two days to [propose](../proposal/).
