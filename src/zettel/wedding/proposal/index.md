# My Proposal

_2021-04-05_

I like surprises, but [Camille](https://camille.merose.com)
doesn't. She'd rather be able to look forward to things.
For her, half the pleasure of enjoying, say, a vacation 
comes purely from anticipation. 

I had a challenge before me: How could I give Cam the
biggest surprise of her life while also letting her look 
forward to it?

I originally had the idea to propose to Camille around the 
end of year holidays. Every year, a few days leading up to
Christmas, Camille's family take a trip to the cabins of
Yosemite valley. Proposals at Yosemite Christmas, in the 
Carry family, are practically an unofficial tradition.
Unfortunately for me, the [engagement ring](/zettel/wedding/ring/)
I had picked out needed more time to be made. Plus, I like
to pave my own way. While a proposal in front of family is 
great, I wanted the moment to honor the character of
our relationship. 

Christmas' day of 2019, I acted super weird. I let on that I 
was giving Camille a Big Giftâ„¢, the vibes of which she 
definitely picked up on. I am not a good liar. You should 
see my total absence of a poker face when we play cards at
Yosemite Christmas [[1]](#1). The way I pulled off authentic 
engagement-ring-under-the-tree energy was by giving Camille
a trip for Christmas. I gave her a vacation to New Orleans for
the start of Mardi Gras, over Valentines Day weekend.

Camille and I love jazz. Since we got together in 2012, music
has been a cornerstone of our relationship. And, as you can [probably
guess](/pesto/), Camille and I love food. For these reasons 
(and the allure of gator tours), Cam and I have talked about taking
a trip to New Orleans together for forever.

"I was sure that he was going to propose in New Orleans," Grandma
Shirley would tell us later. I'm glad I gave off that impression.
I had something different in mind. 

Camille and I moved to Oakland in 2018 so that she could attend Mills
College for her Masters. We moved to a place right off Piedmont Ave,
which happened to be right next to the 
[Mountain View Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View_Cemetery_(Oakland,_California)) [[2]](#2).

that year.
