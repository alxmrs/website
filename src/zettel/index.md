# Hypertext a la Zettelkasten

Ideally, I don't want my website to be _just_ a blog. 

I don't think in terms of sequences of posts. I am not 
trying to create a newsletter – while this seems fun, 
the upkeep feels like more of a burden than empowered expression. 
Why not, instead, aim to express systems of ideas free of time?

I have a [lot of ideas](ideas/), but most of them are small and 
only make sense in context with other thoughts. 
While I can often coalesce these scattered thoughts into 
coherent essays, this takes time and effort I seldom muster. 

[Every new years day](goals) I conceive of a "nice-to-have" resolution to start writing. 
Visions dance before me of emulating great technical blogs that I spend the year reading.
Alas, it never goes this way, due to a sense of perfectionism and habit inertia. 

My dear friend [eve](http://eatbigger.fish) mentioned the other day that they were getting into this 
style of hypertext called [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/).
Parsing the (admittedly, lengthy) introduction filled me with excitement – this is
the approach that I'm looking for. 

My intentions, given this new style of thinking, are as follows: 
- Organize the media in my life into a web of atomic connections, based on the Zettelkasten method and my own preferences for hypertext media.
  - What media? Why not include every bookmark saved for later, every note scrawled on my phone, all the (legible) journal pages I've deemed publishable, and every podcast episode that's filled me with joy?
- ???
- Profit.

Well, let's see how this experiment goes.

I'll update this page with entry-points into my Zettlekasten.
