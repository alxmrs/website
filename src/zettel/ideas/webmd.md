# WebMD Browser Extension

Here an idea for a tractable software project: A 
Chrome extension for browsing WebMD.

Once a user ends up on a page of some affliction, the
extension lets the user select which symptoms they
experience (likely interface: checkboxes). Then, the
extension uses the input with Bayes law to calculate 
[how likely it is that you _actually_ have the disease](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life##:~:text=40.).
