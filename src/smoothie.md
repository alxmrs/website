I make a smoothie for myself every morning.

One half cut of frozen batteries

AA, AAA, 9-Volt,

You can have just one variety, too. 

Add three-fourths cup of bleach

to make it easier to blend, 

less if you like a thinker gulp. 

Fresh plastic adds easy petroleum 

that you can't taste, and a 

good green color, to boot. 

Some say local spider pollen

helps with your allergies, 

but I can't say it's worked for me.
