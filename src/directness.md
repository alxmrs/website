# Speaking Directly

(WIP, come back later.)

I may have figured out a [goal for 2021](goals.md):
to speak more directly, to say what I mean.

I've trained myself to speak defensively at work and
in social situations. For example, instead of saying,
"Are you going to do X?", I say: 
"What are you going to do?" In code reviews, I also 
phrase things as questions or use the passive voice
instead of making commands.


This is a reaction to an old 
habit of guessing what people around me are going to
say before they say it
