Notes from the _Community Emergency Response Team_ Program

Overview
* Fire Safety
* Disaster medical
* Light search & rescue
* CERT organization
* Disaster psych
	* Nobody gets through this unscathed. How do we take care of ourselves and each other? 
* CERT and terrorism
	* Basically, we don't deal with terrorist events. Outside of scope; leave it to the pros. 


## Unit 1: Hazards
Objectives
* Roles 
* types of hazards
* Undertake actions
* functions of CERT
	* CERT has two different options: First, a responsibility to take care of ourselves, families, and neighbors. Second, how can we help the broader community? 
	* We may never get deployed to help the community. But, everything learned here can be used to support oneself, family, neighborhood. 
	* This is not the end all be-all. Continued training, refreshers, radio, CPR, First Aid is encouraged. If you don't use it, you lose it. Hard to remember everything. 
		* This is more of an intro to disaster preparedness
	* _stop the bleed class_: will be offered in the future (here), sometime in the spring. 

Roles & Responsibilities
* Want to be prepared to mitigate/lesson impacts of disasters
* All community members should take steps to prepare
* Best when it is specific to idiosyncrasies of the community in question. 
	* e.g. Central coast doesn't need to prepare for tornadoes. 
	* We need to prepare for earthquakes --> power outages | fires | blocked roads | food insecurity | power scarcity 

Government
* gov't has responsibility to 
	* dev test refine emergency plans
	* ensure responders are sufficiently equipped and skilled
	* services to protect
* we are a small community, small gov't. so, we need to get by without public services. thus, we need to be prepared.
	* Q: are services proportional to the population? 
	* A: Yes, in the state of CA, more or less. In SBC, we're overstaffed based on the table (2 ambulances, have 50 deputies) on paper
		* We are grossly understaffed due to turnover; wedged between a lot of affluent regions (hard to recruit) with relatively small footprints
		* Distinction btw population vs land size. SBC is the state of RI in land size, but the pop is more modest. lot of ground to cover.

Emergency Operations Plan
* Assigns resp to organizations and indiv (who does what)
	* in 2017, both fire and sheriffs where in charge, leading to a pissing contest. Two diff command posts, didn't talk to each other, wasn't effective. 
	* Clear comms needed, as well as disjoint responsibilities, and a clear chain of command.
	* Law enf is default responsible for evacuation. however, fire is in charge of water rescue. 

Community leaders
* Elected personelle who have a responsibility to prepare community
	* participate on local planning councils
	* id and integrate resources into plans
* in 2017 floods, the shelter location was a place that wasn't accepting animals; people won;t go there

The Public
* Community alerts
	* SBC alerts
* Take training
* Practice skills and personal plans
* Networking, help others
* Give feedback to community 
* Volunteer

Exercise: Crash landing on the moon
* Situational awareness
* Sizeup 
	* Gather facts

Types of disaster
* Natural
* Technological
* Intentional 

Key disaster elements
* No warning / unexpected
	* Sometimes, we do have an idea if there will be a disaster. 
		* severe weather --> evac warnings
	* There are redundant systems (alerts, social media, etc.). But, it is also upon you to have backup systems. 
* Emergency personnel may be overwhelmed
* Lives, health, and the environment are endangered

_Police, Fire, etc. aren't coming. You don't know. Should you go or should you stay? How do you know?_

_Amateur Radio_ is always the last form of communication for disasters. 
GMRS Radios. Can purchase from box stores. 
See exam / club - SBC has a club! May 3 you can get licensed!
Radio can transmit messages to cell phones far away!
License is good for 10 years and covers your entire family!
Q: What do people do in a radio club? 
A: Meet once a week, test phones / talk, set up repeaters, have better coverage than cell phones!

Our dispatch center is still in SC. Call 911, it goes there, then gets dispatched to local resources. 



Firstnet?
iPhone 14+ will switch to a satphone when cell goes out!

Local Hazard Vulnerability
* Id most common disasters that occur
* Id possible hazards with most severe impact
* consider recent or historical impacts
* _Make sure your car isn't below half a tank!_

What's the difference between an evauation order vs warning?
- Warning: you should go, please get you
- Order: you needed to have been gone yesterday
- _Don't wait around for an evautaion order, leave at a warning!_
- If you chose to ignore an order, there will be no emergency response

Dmg to infra
*  Police are working on grave public safety stuff
* FF suppressing major fires
* ... 

There's a law to offer mutual aid in disasters
Q: How are needs communicated in a response? 
A: Admin team works on this; contact {moab}? other networks and ask for resources. CA has lots of such networks; goes to a state level, goes to local region w/in state, then goes to partners btw states. 

Hazards related to structure type
* may not be able to select type of structure when a disaster occurs
* eng'd buildings have performed well in most types of disasters
* in SBC, unrefnforced masonry, chimeneys, etc. were major hazards. Newer buildings are reinforced and are very safe. 
	* If possible, try to be in a building with sprinklers, that is reinforced. 
* Need to know your escape routes for _you_.
	* How many exists does Nob Hill have? Safeway? Target? Where are they? Have you ever looked for an exit besides the front door? 

Hazards from Homes
* Gas line ruptures -- know how to shut off propane tanks
* How do you shut off circuit breakers? 
	* Electric shock potential? e.g. fridge, faulty wiring

Preparing for a disaster
* Know specific needs for yourself and your family. 
* The website has multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation plan. 
	* Data updated every three years!

Protective actions
* What is really going on? 
	* Is there gas actually leaking? Diff between what you prepared for vs what is actually happening
* Can we stay where we are, or do we need to leave? 
* Are there things we need to do to protect airways and breathing? 
	* Do we need to cover windows cause the air is so bad? 
* Do we have masks in the house to protect us from breathing chemicals in the air? 
* How to rm contaminants from your home
* Practice good hygiene. 

Sheltering
* in place: sealing a room
* shelter for an extended time
* mass care or community shelter

Dev disaster plan
* Do you have a plan for where you'll meet family? Do you know how you'll get there? 
* Who is your out-of-state check in contact? 
* How can you escape your home? Doors? Windows? 
* What's the safest place at work, school, church? What's the least safe? 
* What routes can you use to escape your neighborhood? 
* Are you able to pick up your kids --> when _everyone_ is doing the same

Prep for disater
* Can you get your family out of your home and your go bag in 4 minutes
	* have in your car, at home, and at work
* Want to lesson the impact. 
	* There's a small fire, and you can put it out. You have mitigated that disaster. 
	* If you have sufficient insurace, you can mitigate the disaster.

Things we can do in advance
* Anchor heavy furniture
* brace bookcases to the wall
* storm sutters? 
* childproof cabinet doors --> even w/o little kids! big earthquake prepareness. Child safety locks mitigates the mess!
* locate and label gas, electricity, and water in your house to know how to shut it off. 
	* If you need a special tool: where is it? can you find it? 

Other mitigation measures
* Bold houses to foundation
* Propane tanks and chimneys need to be secured
* can you build a safe room? Can you hold up there for a while? What can you do in a pinch? 

Fortify your home
* fortify against home fires, mudslies, etc. 
* in Aromas, we have eukalyptus trees! so prone to fires! They are shallow rooted!

Get Invovled
* Req participation for all
* Training and practice opportunities 

CERT Disaster response
* Respond immediately after a fire
* Be able to turn off your own utilities
* Can you extinguish your own small fires? 
* Can you take care of injuries as much as possible until you can get better treatment? 

Personal protective equipment
* Helmet
* Goggles
* N95 Mask
* Gloves (work and non-latex)
* Sturdy shoes

Non-disaster roles
* Id and aid neighbors/coworkers who might need assistance
	* Deploy in teams. When we deploy, we don't self-deploy in SBC, we do when instructed
* If we get deployed, we wear protective equip
* Make a plan, act on the plan, and re-evaluate. Turn over to professionals when they arive. 
* Help with community events 
* Help with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers

Q: How many CERT-trained people are in SBC? 
A: ??. Don't really have a CERT team, but there isn't a cohesive organized org. Want to do things on a scheduled basis. 
Goal: have cert team do the basic training and other trainings. 
Would love to see a neighborhood watch! Engage with community, see what they need, see how one can help, etc. 
CERT vs NERT (neighborhood)
NextDoor would be a good way to impl CERT -- comm lines. 

Aromas borders the three counties. Other counties do CERT training, this county (SBC) was talking about doing its own CERT team! Want to get Monterey and SC reps out there, too!

It needs to be both an indiv and team effort. 

Q: When there is a call, when and how will it arrive ?
A: It will arrive from us, Anthony + office of emergency services. It's all one big spider web pyramid structure. 

Q: is there something below the CERT? e.g. I live in Santana ranch, we use next door and text. I could go as part of that committee, have a neighborhood thing, give them basic lessons
A: No, there's not anything organized at an official level. 

CERT provides a legal structure -- insurance, liability, etc.  Good Samaritan law. Adv to being under an authority. 

Q: If we get activated, is it on us to get to the location? 
A: Yes. 

Q: If an emergency did happen here, would you send a msg to all the CERT team? 
A: We're not at that level yet. If we had a CERT team, we'd have a roster, and call people out. CERT is strictly a volunteer org. Let's say we made a call out, people would meet at the pre-design staging area. That's the plan to eventually do that. 

Protected for disaster workers
* CERT members are generally protected by good samaritan laws
* Don't act outside of your training
* Not our job to be law enforcement / stop people

Other trainings
* AED: first thing when you enter a building: where are the AEDs. 
* Donations mgmt
* Volunteers need to be managed, too. Sometimes, people have alterior motives
* You can spend forever on the FEMA websites. 
* Sometimes, CERT folks will pay for you to go to some of these classes! e.g. first aid, shelter mgmt, etc.

* Mainly for the trained people of the building

Fire supression don'ts
* Don't get too close
* Don't try to fight it alone
* Don't enter a smoke filled room

Hazardous material
* Corrode other mateiral
* Explode or easily ignited
* React strongly with water
* are unstable when exposed to heat or shock
* Are otherwise toxic to humans, animals, env via absorption inhalation, injection or injestion

Stored Hazmats
* e.g. pool chemical sign
* ~w~ unusual reactivity with water 
* OX: oxidizing properties
* If you see either of those -- or another sign, stop! They exceed our training skill and ability. leave to the pros. 

Experience: the labels are not always accurate! e.g. truck drivers

Unit Summary
* Know how to supress fires
* CERT sizeup
* Classes of fire extinguisher
* PASS
* how to id hazardous material 

Always follow safety rules. Personal safety comes first!

## Unit 3: Disaster Medical Ops

_2025-03-08_

Q: How was CERT involved in the fires in LA, or 911, or Hawaii? 
A: Not sure if Hawaii has a CERT program. CERT programs are behind the scenes, e.g. in the red cross, etc. they don't get a lot of pub, but they are out there. Every time there is a natural disaster, they are out there. 
The people who have the best chance of survival are those who have done their training. 

Airplanes: "Now, I pay attention to the emergency trainings before takeoff. I visualize what could happen, I pay attention to who is sitting around me. I think how I could help."

Q: Does this stress you out? 
A: There is a difference btw worry and preparation. Preparation is coming up with a response, not a reaction. I find that when I have situational awareness, I am more prepared to respond. When i don't know and I get into a rabbit hole of what I can't control, I tend to worry. Prepping makes me feel more relaxed. 

Anthony: Training can help you feel more relaxed. If you've seen it before a billion times, what's a billion in one? 

"I hate being dependent on other people."

"I once came from a worry standpoint. Then I got this job and did a lot of public safety training. I took it seriously and learned a lot. Tragedy of the station fire. Shortly after that training, I went to a show at the Catalyst in SC. I started to feel that feeling of what I knew could go wrong. But I did what you did, I started talking myself out of it. I planned where I would go out in the show if something went wrong. I transitioned from worrying to having tools to alleviating feer"

Anthony: It starts with situational awareness. For anything, you have to be aware. A lot of us sleepwalk through life (phones, emails, etc.). It helps with terrorism, natural disasters, etc. Once you do that, you'll open your eyes up, and then you'll be able to start preparing. 

"Why do cops sit at the back wall in public places? Do you think they know where the exists are?"

There is an active shooting drill next week! People tend to be reactionary. There are higher enrollments in this class in reaction to recent fires (e.g. Moss Landing). 

"I almost got run off the road the other day."

"Developing situational awareness takes practice. It's a muscle that we strengthen."

"I used to have a dinner with my buddies to talk about preparedness. Have a preparedness night!" --> Disaster Dinner!

Disaster Med Ops - Part 1

Going to talk about the major causes of death. This is bc we want to do the most good for the most people. This practically means, we want to try to keep em alive a little longer. 

Assumptions
* Number of victims could exceed the capacity for treatment locally
* Survivors need to assist each other
	* They'll do what they know how to do
* Q: Where is the nearest trauma center? 
	* Salinas
		* This is, if you're lucky, a 25 min drive.
	* Or San Jose!
	* You can be overwhelmed immediately. Mass causality incident.
		* Imagine a bus. 

Importance of Quick Action
* Phase 1: Death within minutes, severe trauma
* Phase 2: several hours
* Phase 3: several days or weeks (infection)

CERT Training
* Treatment for life threateneing conditions: airway obstruction, bleeding, _shock_
	* Shock is definitely a killer! Not talked about

START
* ST :=  Simple Triage
* stART := And Rapid Treatment

You have to practice! Has anyone dealt with anyone bleeding out? No? Then the first time is going to be hard. 

Three "Killers"
* Emergency medicine "killers"
	* Airway obstr
	* Bleeding
	* Shock
* 1st priority of medical ops
	* Open airway -- nothing else matters if they can't breathe
	* Control bleeding
	* Treat shock

How to approach a victim
* Be sure victim can see you
* ID yourself
	* name and organization (e.g. CERT)
* Request permission to treat, if possible
	* if unconscious, premission is assumed
* Respect cultural differences

Head-tilt / chin-lift method. 
* one hand on forehead
* another hand on jaw
* When ppl are conscious, there is muscle rigidity. 

Types of Bleeding - 1
* Arterial bleeding
	* spurting with the heart beat
	* only have a couple minutes to address
* Venous bleeding
	* Slower, lower pressure
	* as blood returns back to the heart
	* Oozing, still significant
* Capillary bleeding
	* Normal abraison and cuts
	* unluckly to die

Control Bleeding
* 3 main methods
	* Direct pressure
	* Elevation
	* Pressure points
		* e.g. squish arteries to the bone
* Firm direct pressure is very effective

Pressure Points
* Arm
	* just above the elbow
* Femoral pressure point
	* above the upper thigh
* Popliteal pressure point
	* behind the knee
* Will at least slow down the bleeding

Shock
* Results of ineffective circulation of the blood
* Shock --> death of 
	* cells
	* tissues
	* organs

Recognizing Shock
* Rapid ans hallow breathing
* Capillary refill of greater than 2 seconds
	* check finger tips, pinch fingers
	* Also, "profusion"
* Failure to follow simple cmds, such as "squeeze my hand"
* Symptoms of shock are easily missed! Pay careful attention to your patient!
* Treat shock by having a person lay down, elevate feet, cover w/ blanket

CERT sizeup
1. Gather facts
2. Assess dmg
3. consider probabilites
4. Assess your situtaion
5. Establish priorities
6. make decisions
7. ... [see above]

What is Triage? 
* Process for mgmt of mass casualty events
	* Victims are evaluated
	* victims are sorted by urgency of need
	* victims are set up for immediate or delayed treatment

Triage
* Immediate (I): life threatening: airway, blooding, shock
* Delayed (D): do not jeopardize victims life, treatment can be delayed
* Minor (M): walking wounded and generally ambulatory (able to walk)
* Dead (DEAD): No respiration after two attempts to open airway
	* Really hard for a lot of us

Rescuer Safety During Triage
* If hazmat or terrorist event is suspect, CERT members DO NOT respond
	* Evacuate as safely as possible
* ALWAYS wear PPE
	* helmet
	* goggles
	* N95
	* work gloves
	* sturdy shoes or boots
	* non-latex exam gloves

Triage process
1. Stop look listen and think (respond, don't react)
2. Conduct voice triage
	1. are you ok? can you hear me? my name is alex, how can I help you? Can you come out? can you squeeze my hand? 
3. Start where you stand, follow a systematic route
	1. this is a major event. school-bus vs train. lots of injured people across a debris field. 
	2. don't skip around, you'll likely miss someone
4. evaluate each victim and tag
5. treat I victims immediately
6. Document triage results

Step 4: Triage evaluation
* Check airway and breathing
* Check circulation and bleeding
* Check mental status

Triage pitfalls
* No team plan, organization or goal
* Indecisive leadership
* Too much focus on one injury
* Treatment (rather than triage) performed

Unit summary
* You should be able to
	* ID the three killers
	* apply techniques for opening the airway, control bleeding, and treat shock
	* Conduct triage under simulated disaster conditions

Have a plan beforehand. We're saving more lives than we ever did before bc we are more organized. 

## Unit 4: Disaster Medical Ops - Part 2

_Video: unit 3 review_ (notes)
* Can decontaminate gloves by dipping in bleach mixture (1:10 bleach to water). It can clean gloves so long as it still smells like bleach.
* Shock in children: blanch test / capillary refresh test is NOT VALID in children! Only mental status counts for children!
* When working in pairs, it's helpful to have an actor and a documenter. There are advantages for people working in pairs. Good to hold each other accountable. 
	* Good to always stay together as a unit. May be surprising -- usually, the instinct is to split up.
	* Even, three is often preferred. e.g. one person could be a driver -- they just drive. person 2 -- navigating, looking for hazards, person 3 -- scribe, documenting. 
		* The more you have documented, the better is is for everyone!


There are legal ramifications for declaring that you are with CERT. It is a national organization. It's best to be activated by CERT officially rather than to volunteer that info. 


Gilory Garlic festival shooting
* CERT volunteer helped ppl with mobility issues get around in the conference
* When the shooting happened, the CERT people that were already there helped transport people away / to safety. 
* They happened to already be there, and they were able to step into an unimaginable role. 

"Aromas is a bad example"
* It is a weird bad example. It sits btw three counties, and all three counties should respond


Unit Objectives
* Take appropriate sanction measures to help protected public health
* Perform head-to-toe patient assessment
* Establish a treatment plan
* Apply splits to suspected fractures and sprains
* Employ basic treatments for other injuries

Topics
* Pub health
* controlling infection
* sanitation (toilets?)
* treating burns
* nasal injuries
* facial injuries
* Cold-related injuries (it does happen here)
* heat realted injuries -- one of the number 1 killers!
* bites & stings

Pub health considerations
* maintaining proper hygiene
* maintaining proper sanitation
* purifying water (if necessary)
* preventing spread of disease

Epi-pen: there are grey areas in offering someone else your medication. Maybe offer it to someone, if they're with-it enough? 

Keep benadrill in your go bags!

Maintain hygiene
* Wash hands frequently
	* or use alcohol sanitizer
* Wear non-latex exam gloves
* Wear N95 masks and goggles
* keep dressing sterile
* avoid contact with body fluids

Maintain sanitation
* control disposal of bacterial sources
* put waste products in plastic bags
	* tie off bags, mark them as medical waste / biohazard
* Bury human waste (poop)
	* e.g. let's say we're w/o power and water for a long time, you can make a toilet with a bucket + plastic bag. or, you can dig a latrine 
		* make sure to mark where the latrine is so you can rm it later

Water sanitation methods
* Boil water for 1 minute
* Water purification tables
* non-perfumed liquid bleach
	* don't use lavender bleach
	* 8 drops/gal of water
	* 16 drops/gal if water is cloudy
	* Let stand for 30 minutes before use

Functions of disaster med ops
* Triage
* Treatment
* Transport
* Morgue
* Supply
	* In SBC, when the roads are impacted in a major event (e.g. floods), not only can't people not get out, but we can't get stuff in!
		* e.g. supplies, ambulances, hospital staff, etc.

Establish a medical treatment area
* Select site and set up treatment area as soon as injured survivors are confirmed
* When determining best location(s) for treatment area, consider:
	* safety of rescuers and survivors
	* most effective use of resources

Q: If ambulances aren't coming, do we transport ppl to hospitals in our own vehicles? 
A: Probably? If it's a huge mass casualty event, then that makes sense. Getting more help takes time. So, this is a good thing to do. There will be a lot of self-transportation. There is liability implied. However, it's important when the situation is serious. Up to individuals to make their own decision. 

Treatment area site selection
* Site selected should be
	* In safe area, free of debris and hazards
	* Upwind, uphill, upstream of hazard zones
		* Think: battery plant fire. What way is the wind blowing? 
		* Wind typically blows from the west to the east (correolis effect!)
	* accessible by transportation vehicles
	* Expandable
		* always make your area bigger than you need. It's easier to shrink it down that it is to make it bigger.
* One of SBC's treatment areas would be the high school
	* large space
	* can set up different areas
	* can land a helicopter there
* Another area would be Belato park

Deployed CERT personnel have coverage. We are not legally required to provide aid. Individuals have to make an informed decision for yourself. CA is a litigious state. Only you can know what you want to do. "Whatever you can live with."

Most effective use of CERT resources
* To meet challenges with limited resources, cert may need to  estab
	* Decentralized medical treatment  loc
	* centralized med treatment location

Treatment Area Layout
* Foru areas
	* I immediate care
	* D delayed care
	* M for minor injuries / walking wounded
	* Dead for morgue

Treatment area org
* Assign treatment leader to each treatment area
* Doc thoroughly
	* avail identifying info
	* description (age, sex, body build, estimated height)
	* clothing
	* injuries
	* treatment
	* transfer location
* Can you tell a family member where the injured person is when you don't know them? 

Head to toe assesment
...


Q: Photos as documentation? 
A: iffy. As a private citizen, you can do that, but it's not sanctioned by CERT
use discretion. e.g. take pictures of people that you transport 
All photos -- the whole phone -- can be subpoena. 

DCAP-BTLS
* Deformaties
* Contusions
* Abrasions
* Punctures
* Burns
* Tenderness
* Lacerations
* Swelling

Where and when
* Light dmg: asses in place
* moderate dmg: move to treatment area first
* assets and tag everyone
* both verbal and hands on

Conducting head2toe assessment
* pay careful attention
* look, listen, feel
* check own hands for patient bleeding
* if you suspect a spinal injury, in unconscious survivors, treat accordingly
* check PMS (pulse movement sensation) in all extremities
* look for medical ID

Comment: this stuff is a little advanced. It does take a lot of practice and training. This is more like EMT stuff.

Order of assessment
1. head
2. neck
3. shoulders
4. chest
5. arms
6. abdomen
7. pelvis
8. legs

Closed-head, neck and spine injuries
* do not harm: min mov't of head and neck

Treating burns
* Conduct good sizeup
* treat with first aid
	* cool burned area
	* cover with sterile cloth, reduce risk of infection
		* serious burns are really susceptible

Burn severity
* Temp of burning agent
* period of time survivor exposed
* area of body affected
* size of area burned
* depth of burn

Burn classification
* Superficial: epidermis
* Partial thinkness: dermis and epi
* Full thinkness: subcutaneous layer and all layers above
	* black

Burn treatment: DOs
* Cool skin or clothing if they are still hot
* Cover burn loosely with dry sterile dressing

Burn treatment: DON'Ts
* Use ice
* Apply antiseptics or ointments
* Remove shreds of tissue, blisters, etc.
