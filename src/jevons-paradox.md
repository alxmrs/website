Just because a system or process becomes more efficient, doesn't mean it consumes less energy. In fact, it's possible that when it becomes more efficient, it leads to an _increase_ in demand. 

Notable Examples: 
- Google SERP webpage optimization (pages were more lightweight) lead to an _increase_ of server load. Suddenly, people from NBU countries were able to access the pages that they weren't able to load before.
- Solar/renewable energy has been become exponentially cheaper. Thus, energy generation has become substantially more efficient. However, the proportion of the energy grid that renewables makes up has remained more or less constant for several decades because energy demand has also grown at similar rates (via [the superorganism paper](economics-for-the-future--beyond-the-superorganism.md)).
- When cars in the US (or, at least, California) were mandated to become more efficient — either by fuel economy or electrification — they also, more often then not, became physically bigger. The electric hummer, for example, has the same carbon footprint as a gas-powered sedan.
