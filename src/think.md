I read an article today that said I should think for myself. If I did that, would I be blindly doing what I've been
told? What has thinking for myself gotten me, really? Thoughts are like snowflakes: totally unique, but most are
extremely similar.

Maybe, It's not enough in this day and age to think for yourself. You must now think for someone else. Once you've
established a pattern of independent thought, then begins the work of preparing it for broadcast. The truest way to
believe anything is to try to convince someone else of it.

> Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire
> what others desire because we imitate their desires.

â€“ _[Mimetic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory)_

Thinking for someone else introduces momentum within the social recurrence. I desire to think for myself, to desire that
of the self-thinkers, and so should you.
