I read an article today that said I should think for myself. If I did that, would I be blindly doing what I've been
told? What has thinking for myself gotten me, really? Thoughts are like snowflakes: totally unique, but most are
extremely similar.

Maybe, It's not enough in this day and age to think for yourself. You must now think for someone else. Once you've
established a pattern of independent thought, then begins the work of preparing it for broadcast. The truest way to
believe anything is to try to convince someone else of it.

> Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire
> what others desire because we imitate their desires.

– _[Mimetic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory)_

Thinking for someone else introduces momentum within the social recurrence. I desire to think for myself, to desire that
of the self-thinkers, and so should you.

# The Three Voices

_December 30, 2024_

I have been reading on the internet for most of my brief 32 years. In that time, I've noticed there are three voices for
text on the web. The first is memoir. People describe their experience. The second is advice. I implore you, you
simply _must_ do `X`. The third, maybe the most beautiful, is map making. People document the truth to the best
of their ability to know it.

My big lament about the web – or, the slice of it that I tend to read – is that there is too much of the second voice.

I grew up fascinated by computers. You couldn't pry me away from them, much to the worry of my parents. They tried
to put me in sports camps, to get me outside as much as possible. I was too much of a screen moth, drawn
into the glow of my Netscape browser and expansive world of Neopets Dot Com. It wasn't all fun and games – I had mouths
to feed! – more often then not, by [Giant Omelette](https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=giantomelette).

You'll never believe the deciding factor for them to let me indulge in my obsession: My parents consulted a local
psychic. They told her their concerns – I certainly didn't grow up the way they did – and the psychic listened. She
reassured them, "Actually, I think there could be a future with Alex and computers. You should let him follow this
interest." The rest, they say, is history.

I grew up in the golden age of [Geocities](https://neocities.org/browse) and Macromedia Flash. The bazaar that is the
web was much less organized. It was quirky. It was weird. It was certainly less commercial. Browsing the web felt like
exploring the labyrinths of a new experimental art gallery – well, maybe if a significant number of the exhibits
were [graphically violent cartoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Tree_Friends).

I think somewhere along the way, as people figured out how to make it commercial – to sustain those of us who tried
to make a living contributing small pieces of the web, the default voice changed. The incentive structures changed,
and people will, if anything, do what they're incentivized to do. 

For almost multiple decades, I found myself reading the second voice. And I loved advice! I would grow up reading 
Lifehacker every day, dreaming of my optimal self. Two years ago, I conducted some digital archeology out of boredom and
found saved Tim Ferris advice columns in what once was my Google Reader feed. Even recently, I find myself consuming
advice from hackernews, like many of my peers.
