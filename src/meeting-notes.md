I took the notes in [a meeting today](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18P_Uk2aL1hfcaJf4PJfYZJzmhvMSJjdmB_AJvjiZOVM/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.7x09t4im0tmh). I usually take notes in meetings because I'm a good notetaker, and sometimes I get complements for this skill. Today, though, I got an unusual one: In the middle of a discussion that I was capturing, someone paused and asked, "Is this an AI note-taking services? I don't think so because it's making spelling mistakes." I looked up from my keyboard a bit surprised, bearing a smile. 

It made me think a bit about the differences between how humans and AIs take notes. One reason why she may have thought that I was an AI is that I've gotten really good at co-transcribing-and-summarizing ideas – mostly, from my previous life as a high-school debater. I think this _is_ something that an AI note-taking service could reasonably learn to do, though I don't know of a service that does this today. Doing so lets me keep up to pace with the conversation as it's happening. Passing a reverse Turing Test for note-taking is definitely a skill that one can learn with practice – especially, when practiced on a [spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreading_(debate)) opponent in a debate. (A related useful skill is being able to write notes like this while simultaneously thinking of things to say – a subject for another time.)

There's an aspect of this style of note-taking that I think would be non-trivial to replicate in an any AI-powered system – a feature that might seem totally trivial: That is, I know when and where to add the right indentations. The ability to organize threads hierarchically yet faithfully to the conversation at hand I think would be quite difficult for an automated system. It requires a decent context of not only what is being said, but how it relates to concepts mentioned in and _out_ of the conversation. Maybe this would require a decent [world model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqBwKCabTXA) or reasoning capabilites; I'm not totally sure. The AI note-taking systems I've seen that approximate such a feature seem to require human collaboration. 

It reminds me of what a teacher once said on social media about the ChatGPT-generated homework of her students: It's writing full of mediocre ideas with perfect grammar and spelling. AI notes may provide perfect transcriptions and clean auto-generated summaries, but they are mediocre at what I like to use meetings for: as a medium that [lets me forget](https://www.reproof.app/blog/notes-apps-help-us-forget).
