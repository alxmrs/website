I took the notes in a meeting today[^1]. Sometimes I get complements on how I take notes. Today, though, I got an unusual one: In the middle of a discussion that I was capturing, someone paused and asked, "Is this an AI note-taking services? I don't think so because it's making spelling mistakes." I looked up from my keyboard a bit surprised, bearing a smile. 

It made me think a bit about the differences between how humans and AIs take notes. One reason why she may have thought that I was an AI is that I've gotten really good at simultaneously transcribing and summarizing ideas – mostly, from my previous life as a high school debater. I think this _is_ something that an AI note-taking service could reasonably learn to do, though I don't know of a service that does this today. Doing so lets me keep up to pace with the conversation as it's happening. Passing a reverse Turing Test[^2] for note-taking is definitely a skill that one can learn with practice – for example, when you have take notes from a spreading[^3] opponent in a debate. (A related useful skill is being able to write notes like this while simultaneously thinking of things to say – a subject for another time.)

There's an aspect of this style of note-taking that I think would be non-trivial to replicate in an any AI-powered system – a feature that might seem totally trivial: That is, I know when and where to add the right _indentations_. The ability to organize threads hierarchically (and faithfully!) in a conversation should be quite difficult for an automated system. It requires decent context,  not only of what is being said, but how it relates to concepts mentioned _outside_ of the conversation. Maybe this would require a decent world model[^4] or reasoning capabilities; I'm not totally sure. The AI note-taking systems I've seen that approximate such features require human collaboration. 

It reminds me of what a teacher once said on social media about the ChatGPT-generated homework of her students: it's writing mediocre ideas with perfect grammar and spelling. AI notes may provide clean transcriptions and auto-generated summaries, but they are mediocre at capturing the nuances of the conversation. After all, these details matter quite a bit for the goal of taking notes in the first place: they're a medium for memory, or maybe, a medium that lets me forget[^5].
