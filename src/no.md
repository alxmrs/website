Jan 1, 2026

I write this from the veterinary hospital. My one-year-old cat Twiggy ate a dozen hair ties last night while we were at a friend’s house celebrating NYE. Alas, what an omen for 2026. I am almost certain that she’ll be ok. She’s always been our little diva, and now I have the vet bill to prove it. 

The waiting room of a vet hospital just so happens to be an excellent place to do this goal setting excuse. As I have [written about before], my wife and I have a tradition of setting goals around new years. Every time we perform this ritual, we try to find a therapeutic place outside of our normal surroundings. Maybe, we can better inspect the shape of our life if we momentarily step outside of it. They’re playing calming music here and the seats are comfortable enough. On with the visioning!

For 2025, I earnestly joked that I had no New Year’s resolutions, since I was perfect the way I am. 2025 has been a big year for self acceptance for me. I am proud of the work I’ve done here, to be happy in my own skin. Building on this, I have noticed that there are ways I can grow that are still self-compassionate. Ruminations on the theme have been ringing in the back of my mind. Just in the past few days, I figured out what my 2026 could be for me. I want 2026 to be the year of “no”.

I naturally am a person who says “yes.” I invite people in. I emanate an aura of “come as you are.” I diligently volunteer. I rise to the challenge… usually, for battles imprudently picked. A positive trait in many cases, I always seem to over extend. Are the people pleased? Do I even like them in the first place? Every strength has its shadow side, and mine is mired in overcommitment. 

At work, I often recite a quote attributed to Steve Jobs: “Focus means saying ‘no’ to good ideas.” I mutter this mantra to myself every time I start to get excited about a new side quest. Indeed, as I’ve grown in my profession, I do a decent job of selecting the right problems. I’ve noted somewhere before that to grow as a junior engineer means saying “yes” more often than not, while growing as a senior engineer means saying “no.” Though, I think this hallowing of focus ought to extend beyond career. To really embody self acceptance, I ought to accept that I can say “no” sometimes, maybe even often, to stay true to my interests and values. I want 2026 to be a year of focus. 

## Exercise: what obligations really matter to me?

I’ve got a lot of projects going on, personal and professional. Many of these involve things that I’ve committed to. Of these commitments, I have three choices: I can give them my all, do the minimum, or try to get out of my obligation. Here is a scattered list of what I have going on, and how much I want to continue participating. 

	•	Aromas Day
	◦	I am an aromas day planner. I make the event's website, which doesn’t take too much of my time. This past year, I volunteered to manage the next Aromas Day’s vendors. This involves managing a database (read; a google sheet) of vendor applications, curating which ones will be green lit to be invited to sell their wares on the day of the event, and maintaining quick communication between all parties. 
	◦	I want to give this commitment my all. The reason is that one of my two values in life is “community,” and I see this role in the event, let alone the existence of the event itself, as one of the best ways that I help foment community where I live. 
	•	The Aromas Eagles
	◦	I maintain this community organization’s website, and I regularly go to meetings (once a month, give or take)
	◦	I want to do the minimum here. This means minimal to no volunteering for extra obligations. I will merely participate, and do what I am asked. But, for now, I don’t see myself volunteering to do much beyond this.
	◦	That said, I am more than happy to be plugged in to the goings on in this pillar of my home town. 
	•	The Aromas Grange
	◦	I just won the election for a 3 year executive member for our local community grange. They have a number of community efforts that I believe in, for example, like helping protect our immigrant neighbors. I have grand ideas for projects to start here, like figuring out ways to better support our community with finding health care coverage. These ideas are nascent, and I would need to do a lot of research to find a practical thing that would make a positive material difference. Further, I have some interest in figuring out how to start a community run microgrid (https://www.pge.com/assets/pge/docs/save-energy-and-money/rebate-and-incentives/PGE-MIP-Handbook.pdf) with assistance from my cousin, Meera, a talented electrical engineer. 
	◦	I think my decision is to do the minimum (what I am asked), except to watch for opportunities to make an impact. 
	▪	Related: one of my previous managers gave me the advice to keep having ideas, but to wait for the most strategic time to share them (instead of when they arise). 
	▪	I think I’ll do that with the grange. I know some community members who are working to start something with healthcare and others who want to put solar on the grange. I think I’ll try to be plugged in with this role and look for opportunities to “Yes, And” projects that others want to champion. 
	•	Home improvements 
	◦	We bought a home in 2025! This year, we replaced the roof and added solar panels. That was maybe more than we bargained for. We have lofty visions for what we want to do with our home and other major, but delayable repairs. 
	◦	I hope ( 🤞) that we can get away with planned major improvements and renovations for our home this year. I’ll carve out an exception for gardening and landscaping, which has been very DIY for us so far (championed by my spouse).
	•	Projects at my day job
	◦	I don’t want to spoil the surprise about what I’m working on these days at Open Athena. However, I can say that out of the range of possibilities for what I could work on, my teammate and I are doing our best to narrow scope to essential concerns of our mission. Every day there are so many interesting modeling ideas to explore, that this is non-trivial to do! And yet, it’s probably for the best to have this incentive to regularize. 
	◦	I am fully committed to this one and want to give work my all — insofar as I know which problems are worthy of solving.
	•	Cubed
	◦	This is an open source project I have minorly contributed to (mainly issues, a few PRs), but that I care a lot about. I talk to the maintainer regularly in the Distributed Array Working Group. 
	◦	I wrote a blog post last year about figuring out how to run the framework on accelerators at scale. I haven’t started this project yet, and I haven’t found a need to do so. 
	◦	I will keep my involvement to a minimum, but keep going to array working group meetings. Further, I will try to network as best as I can to help advance the mission of the cubed project. 
	▪	Caveat: it may come to pass that I start to use Cubed in my work. At that point, I’ll let the needs of the priorities of my work determine how much more involved to be. 
	•	arrow-zarr
	◦	I have somewhat volunteered to review PRs and integrate this package into my own project (see below)
	◦	I plan on no longer being involved. 
	◦	Rational: I don’t have enough strength in rust to meaningfully contribute. Further, there are other similar technical bets that are a better fit for me to participate in. 
	•	xarray-sql + zarr-datafusion
	◦	I started xarray-sql, an Xarray as a database experiment. And I closely collaborate with Jayendra, who has developed zarr-datafusion, a related effort in rust. 
	◦	I’m going all in on these two projects, so long as I can maintain them outside of working hours. 
	◦	Rational: as someone who values community, I think these two tools are likely to bring a lot more people into the climate informatics community. Further, these projects, especially xarray-sql, seem like things that I uniquely can implement — I don’t know if these would exist if I weren’t a part of them.
	◦	Beyond building the libraries themselves, I hope to also invest in writing blog posts and giving conference talks!
	•	Travel
	◦	I remember once saying that Camille and I take every flimsy excuse to travel we get. The usual rationale here is that we’re willing and able to go out of our way to be there for our community.
	◦	This year, I want to be more selective with how we travel. Ideally, we will spend more time at home than we have the last few years. I really love being with my two cats. Further, when we do travel, I want to prioritize domestic travel rather than international. 
	▪	This one will be hard, I think, because there are a lot of international conferences related to work happening this year. What good opportunities to practice saying “no.”
	•	Vagabonvivants.com
	◦	Cam and I are still writing our travel blog, albeit very slowly. 
	◦	I say, I’ll make a best effort to continue this, but really on a minimum basis. 
	•	Other writing projects 
	◦	I have a draft of an essay I want to submit somewhere when it is ready and then one I want to collaborate with a lawyer friend on and then some blog posts for work. 
	◦	I honestly hope that I spend more time and effort here than currently! For writing, I’m all in. 
	•	Projects not yet begun
	◦	Become a radio DJ
	▪	I had aspirations to join ksqd and play music that I have curated over the years. 
	▪	I’ll say, “not this year.”
	◦	Start a podcast
	▪	I was thinking about starting a “micro podcast” where I would distribute snippets of thoughts via RSS feed via my personal site. 
	▪	I’ll also say “not right now” to this idea. Maybe one day. 
	◦	Other things I’m forgetting
	▪	You’ve probably guessed it, I’ll default to “no” however I can.

## Hypothesis: Embodying “no” to update habits

I had a realization the other day that the things I’m working on in therapy — namely, learning how to tolerate distress and emotional discomfort — are actually broadly applicable to a range of issues that I initially thought were irrelevant. The realization came about because I spoke with a cousin who just started GLP1 drugs and vividly described what they felt like. I had previously heard about how these drugs work, including talk about turning off “food noise” and reducing “emotional eating” — but it wasn’t until I had heard this relative’s lived experience that I really understood the implications. She noted that the drugs also had been found to be effective at curbing people’s other addictive tendencies, like drinking. If this class of miracle drugs functioned by simply making people more aware of their own bodies, would it be possible to have a similar effect through dedicated practice alone? 

Losing weight is the infamous unachieved new years goal. This checkbox has certainly been on many of my new years resolutions past. There are other similar aspirations that I’ve had related to my everyday habits, like reducing social media use. What if the lessons I’ve been practicing this year in therapy — learning to embrace the feelings of stress and discomfort related to certain triggers instead of falling prey to bad reactions — could be used to more generally shape my habits? What if feeling your feelings could be a powerful, all encompassing tool?

I’m entering the new year trying a new experiment: what if I said “no” to many of the habits I currently have that I want to change and instead say “yes” to the negative feelings that not doing them brings up? As an example, this holiday season, there have been so many cookies at my house. Pretty much any time I pass the box of chocolate chip wonders that my wife bakes annually, I eat one. So far in this experiment, I’ve been saying no to this instinct, and instead paying attention to the subtle signs of “food noise” that I had not previously noticed. Without getting too much in my head about it, I am starting to gain a distinction for really desiring a sweet versus merely the minorly compelling force of a positive experience from consuming one. What’s funny is that this practice of feeling my feelings as they relate to food has been excellent “cross training” for the things I’m working on in therapy. Weird how that goes sometimes. 

I think this could really help me adjust my media diet as well. I think a big reason I scroll so much (derogatory) on social media is that I’m using it to escape negative emotions. While this coping mechanism has served me well enough so far, I think I’d rather replace it with more sublime pleasures, like writing or working on another of my many projects. Better still, I would love to simply feel these negative emotions head on. Maybe with practice, I can identify within myself a sense of “media food noise” and separate it from the more enriching cravings for community, connection and curation that I receive from the internet (often, on social media).

## 10 years of goals: a retrospective

I’ve been doing this practice of goal setting every year for ten years. I don’t have all the artifacts with me now, but I remember many of the goals set, accomplished, and not yet attained. Every few years, I’d come up with a new system where it will “always be like this from now on,” until the next year where I reinvent it all over again. If the medium is the message, how else can I really have something new to say?

In the early years, like the mid 2010s when I was just entering college, my goals revolved around establishing myself. They were really check-boxy. Being honest with myself, they almost always have been check-boxy. It’s funny, I’ve been really proud of how many boxes I’ve checked over the years! I got my dream job. I got married. I kind of even helped make a new algorithm (if you count working on an ML model as an algorithm — of course, as part of a team). But now, it feels maybe a bit embarrassing to think this way. 

My wife, meanwhile, always took a different approach. Right from the beginning, she framed her goals as a set of things she would stop doing, start doing, or keep doing. Camille has always been one of the most confident people that I know, and her self love I find to be infectious. This is the way to set goals if they don’t come from an impulse to be someone different than who you are. I get it now. A checkbox can get you moving to somewhere else with gusto, but it can’t answer if that’s the right direction to go. The Kurt Vonnegut line always hits: “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” 

I have a much better sense of who I am pretending to be. The one thing that I wish for myself is to focus on that, to simply do less. And for this reason, I am resolved to make this a year of saying “no.”
