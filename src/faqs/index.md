<summary>What do you do for work?</summary>

I work at Google Research on the Anthromet team where I develop machine-learning applications for weather. I used to
work on the [Arcs project](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs), a system to protect user privacy in the AI era. Before
joining Google, I've had a mix of software engineering and machine learning roles.

<summary>Where are you from?</summary>

All over California, really. I grew up in [San Diego](/zettel/san-diego/) (north county) and went to college there, too.
I lived in Oakland for a few years, then in the Santa Cruz / Monterey area. I recently found myself in the central
coast. Hey, maybe one day I'll end up in Chico or Mt. Shasta.

<summary>What kinds of things do you do for fun?</summary>

I really enjoy traveling. I spent the month of October visiting New York. In the summer, I spent a decent amount of time
getting to know San Luis Obispo and the central coast. I have upcoming plans to bounce around a few other places. I'm
happy doing both city things and well as spending time outdoors. Over the past year, I've been trying to get more into
creative projects. I [write](/blog/) from time to time. I have some [ideas for arts & crafts](/electric-origami/)
and a casual interest in making projector-based interactive digital art.

Generally, I'd say I'm not really a hobby-person so much as I am community oriented. I like to see family & friends
whenever possible, and otherwise make friends out of strangers.

<summary>What kind of music do you like? What have you been listening to recently?</summary>

Why, thank you for asking! In a world of streaming music, it's common to say that one's tastes are eclectic. This
certainly is true for me, however, it doesn't really speak to the shape of my preferences. Instead of telling, let me
try to show what I like (with the help of [everynoise.com](https://everynoise.com)):

* [Here are all my playlists](https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=user&name=djbokonon). I've been cataloguing all
  the songs I come across that are 1) new-to-me and 2) strike my fancy 3) per month and year since ~2016.

* Try clicking on the "tracks" link for a playlist. For
  example, [here are the tracks](https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=1UcLLHgGUDe8lBOuuuiN1Y) in my
  `Spring Refined 2016` playlist. Or, consider
  viewing [the tracks of a more recent playlist](https://everynoise.com/playlistprofile.cgi?id=2NDxw8EduMlWC73ZSOJ21X).
  These will give you a feel of the music and subgenres that I like.

* If a genre seems interesting to you, click the link to explore artists that create music associated with that genre.
  For example, I listen to a bunch of [art pop](https://everynoise.com/research.cgi?mode=genre&name=art%20pop).

<summary>Neat website. How's it made?</summary>

Thanks! This website has almost no client-side javascript; it's mostly generated HTML and CSS. In an effort to keep
things simple, my generator consists of a series of shell scripts that invoke [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (Check out
the [source](https://github.com/alxmrs/website), or
consider [making your own](https://github.com/alxmrs/pandoc-website-template) shell-powered website). This
pandoc-centered static-site-generator lets me write in Markdown and publish in HTML. Though, in theory, I could have
created the website in PowerPoint – a project for another time.

My uses of JS are:

- CloudFlare's privacy-focused web-analytics.
- Obfuscating my `mailto` links.

If you find any part of it that is not accessible or generally unusable, please reach out to me, and I'll correct it.

<summary>Do you have any advice for becoming a software engineer?</summary>

Yes – but that depends a lot on your situation. Please, email me (or reach out some other way). I'm happy to give you my
2¢.

<summary>Oh! I'm a UCSD undergraduate.</summary>

Awesome. I get messages from UCSD undergrads from time to time. One day, I'll write an article with general advice for
students like you. Until then, would you be interested
in [connecting with me on TritonsConnect](https://tritonsconnect.com/user/782505)? From there, I can learn a bit more
about you and provide commensurate advice.
