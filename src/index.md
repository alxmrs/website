# Hi there, I'm Alex Merose!

<img src="https://alexrosengarten.com/assets/website-profile-square.png" title="A picture of me!" id="profile">

I'm a software engineer who (in theory) lives in 
the SF Bay Area. During the pandemic, I'm mostly 
found just outside of Driscoll's strawberry farms in
the Monterey Bay area, if not some beach in Santa 
Cruz. 

I love to listen to all kinds of music, help my 
[lovely partner](http://camimerz.com/) cook a 
[fussy meal](/pesto), and think hard about 
[climate change solutions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy). 

Professionally, I work at Google on the 
[Arcs project](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs). 
Here, I'm building technology to protect user privacy
in the AI era. Before this, I was a machine learning 
engineer at [Aira.io](https://aira.io), a remote 
assistance platform for the blind. 

You can check out my public profiles, reach out to me,
or read [some of my thoughts](/blog).
