# Hi there, I'm Alex Rosengarten!

<img src="/assets/website-profile-square.png" title="A picture of me!" id="profile">

I love languages, human and machine alike. 

I currently work at Google on the [Arcs project](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs). 
Here, I'm building technology to protect user privacy in the AI era.

Before this, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Aira.io](https://aira.io), a remote assistance platform for the blind. 

You can check out my public profiles, reach out to me, or read [some of my thoughts](/blog).
