# Hi, I'm Alex!

<img src="/assets/website-profile-square.png" title="A picture of me!" id="profile">

I'm a software engineer who works in the SF Bay Area. Due to the pandemic, I've been moving around a lot.

I love to listen to all kinds of music, help my [lovely wife](http://camille.merose.com/) cook a
[fussy meal](/pesto/), and think hard about
[climate change solutions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy).

You can check out my public profiles, reach out to me, or read [some of my thoughts](/blog/).
