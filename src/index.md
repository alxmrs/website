# Hi, I'm Alex!

I'm a software engineer who works remotely and [moves around a lot](https://merose.com/2022/).

I love to listen to [all kinds of music](/faqs/#music), help my [lovely wife](http://camille.merose.com/) cook a
[fussy meal](/pesto/), and think hard about
[climate change solutions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy).

You can check out my public profiles, reach out to me, or read [some of my thoughts](/blog/).
