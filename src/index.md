Though friends call me "Al." I am a wearer of multiple hats.

One hat I wear is [_programmer_](https://github.com/alxmrs) (at [OpenAthena.ai](https://openathena.ai), building ML models for ocean physics).  Another is _fellow traveler_ (recently from a [fifteen-month long adventure](https://vagabonvivants.com) with my [wife](https://camille.merose.com)). Another still is _bean club member_ (at [Rancho Gordo](https://www.ranchogordo.com/)). But my favorite is probably the brown Stetson I once picked up from a cowboy store in Wyoming.

Sometimes I collect [thoughts](blog.md), [songs](faqs.md), [little notes](a-second-second-brain.md) â€“ or, in the most desperate of times, _[posts](https://bsky.app/profile/al.merose.com)_. They can mostly be found here. Welcome to my [collection](collection.md)!
