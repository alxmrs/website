But you can call me Al ðŸŽ¶. I'm a software engineer [on sabbatical](https://vagabonvivants.com/why-were-taking-a-gap-year).

I love to listen to [all kinds of music](/faqs/#music), help my [lovely wife](http://camille.merose.com/) cook a
[fussy meal](/pesto/), and think hard about
[climate change solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGEQkws1Low). 
Follow me along my travels [here](https://vagabonvivants.com).

You can check out my public profiles, reach out to me, or read [some of my thoughts](/blog/).
