I’m reading [Cal Newport’s *Digital Minimalism*](https://g.co/kgs/GW6WUJ) right now. What a perfect time to do this,
just as Twitter is on the Musk train to hell.

The book is making me notice how little I really get out of my media consumption habits. Screen Time shows that I spend
four to five hours a day on my phone (_edit: I have mislead myself here by looking at weeks where I was on vacation.
Though, my point still stands with spending 2 hours per day on a screen, too_). That’s a part time job amount of time —
so, what am I getting out of it? Newport
is helping me understand the answer is not much. I’m mostly addicted to social apps that I probably use to escape
emotions instead of process them. While I may get some utility from these platforms, they mostly exploit my attention
for profit. This provides a high opportunity cost: what if I spent this second job worth of free time on “high quality
leisure” instead?

I’m taking the same approach in reading this book as I did when I quite smoking. To quit cigarettes, I
read [Allen Carr’s *The Easy Way*](https://g.co/kgs/LBFdQF), where I didn’t have to stop lighting up
until I finished reading the book. This book actually worked. After finishing it, I never had a cigarette again.

I’m reading *Digital Minimalism* and am using social media at the same time. I find
myself asking why I even like it in the first place. *The East Way* goes on and on about how you don’t
actually like smoking. Smoking make you feel anxious and big tobacco has brainwashed you into thinking that a cigarette
will make this go away (you are temporarily free from withdrawal pain that cigarettes cause). I feel the same effect
with my phone: media makes me feel anxious, from FOMO or boredom or emotional processing debt, and it offers me the
ability to kick the can down the road once more. Cal Newport is less hypnotizing than Carr, but he is effective
nevertheless.

The algorithms can see my disappointment, or the universe is trying to send me a message, because these are the posts
I’ve seen recently about the state of social media:

Hackernews has been the same for 10 years. What’s there to miss out on?

Given all this, I’m taking a digital detox come December.

## What’s a digital detox?

Newport calls this a digital declutter, which is a more accurate description. The idea is to learn to live without most
digital technology for a while so that you know what small bit of it is worth keeping.

I’ve not really done the book justice with my summary of it here. For a better overview, I recommend my friend
Alexander’s post.

## How did I get here?

I don’t think it’s always been this bad. As recently as 2019, I felt pretty at peace with my digital media consumption.
I probably still spent too much time online, but I didn’t really mind. My wife and I were putting our phones to sleep
well before our own bedtime. I consumed a lot of news and social media, but it didn’t feel so all-consuming. Around that
time, I had successfully tamped down my intake of charged political posts.

The pandemic made a huge difference in my habits. Stuck inside and cut off from most human connections, I gave myself
permission to do whatever I needed to get by. With little else to do I spent ***way*** more time online. In the middle
of the pandemic, I started using TikTok, a much more potent content aggregator than I’ve ever used before.

## What can I hope for next?

Instead of connecting more with others online, I’m more looking forward for the opportunity to connect more with myself.
I’d like to spend more time creating in [solitude](https://alxmrs.com/boredom/), including writing. I really
like Newport’s recommendation to write more letters to yourself. I do some form of this already, though I do hope to
make it more of a regular habit.

As far as keeping up with people, I’m already the weird one in my friend groups who randomly calls people on the phone.
And, I have no trouble meeting new people in real life – I once made a friend on Bart!
