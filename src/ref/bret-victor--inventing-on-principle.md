* In your career as a technologist, whenever possible, invent on principle. Find principles to guide everything you build. Live by them.
* "No Modes": The guy who invented copy and paste invented on the principle that software should not contain modes, or different environments to do different things. That directly lead to the invention of copy and paste.
* Bret's principle: when creating an interface, whenever possible, remove the friction between the creator and the creation. (_my memory is fuzzy on this one, I'll have to re-watch the video_).
