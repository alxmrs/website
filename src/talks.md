I was a guest on Jed Sundwall's literature podcast, [Techs on Text](https://techsontexts.net/). We covered a lot of ground in our discussion of two texts ([Convenience Store Woman](https://archive.org/details/convenience-store-woman) by Sayaka Murata and [Marcel Duchamp and the Refusal of Work](https://wahc-museum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Alejandro-Tamayo-Readings.pdf) by Maurizio Lazzarato), touching on the philosophy of work, hegemonic effects of patriarchy, inadequacy of language, and reality's surprising amount of detail.

In this talk, I argue that the Pangeo software collective is not merely an ecosystem for big data geoscience, but
a new database system.

In this talk, I debuted `Xee`, an Xarray extension for Google Earth Engine. I also discussed my other open source data
engineering projects, like `weather-tools`.

## PyData NYC 2022

In this introduction to Apache Beam, I discussed ongoing efforts to support Dask. I spoke about how both portability and
scalability in data engineering are essential to help address the climate crisis.

## PyCon 2018 (Lightning Talk)

My lightning talk was accepted at my first PyCon! I presented a side project to synthesize electronic music with Python.
