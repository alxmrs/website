Apparently, this term doesn't mean much. Why? Well, if a [semilattice](src/semilattice.md) is complete (all subsets hold the meet / join property), then it will be complete in the other direction, making it a [complete-lattice](complete-lattice.md) 

> [A] complete meet-semilattice has all non-empty meets (which is equivalent to being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. 

Why does this term exist? Probably, because we only care about completeness for one operation, either just the _meet_ or just the _join_.
