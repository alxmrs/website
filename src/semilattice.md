A semilattice is like a directed [lattice](src/lattice.md) in either  
the _meet_ (LCM) or _join_ (GCD) direction ("for _any_ nonempty finite subset").  
  
_Meet_-semilattices are "lower semilattices" whereas _join_-semilattices are "upper  
semilattices."  
  
> A set S partially ordered by the binary relation â‰¤ is a meet-semilattice if  
> For all elements x and y of S, the greatest lower bound of the set {x, y} exists.
