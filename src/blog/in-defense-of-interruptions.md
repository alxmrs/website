Many believe that the [global minimum number of interruptions](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/) 
is good for software development. I disagree. Interruptions are inevitable 
and often useful.

## "Interruption" Is A Slur For Collaboration

Interruptions are inevitable. In typical agile shops, there are stand-ups, sprint-plannings, retrospectives, and 
other corporate meetings. Communication takes place on Slack, HipChat, and the like. To butcher Kurt Vonnegut, being 
anti-interruptions "is like being anti-glacier." 

But, are interruptions all bad? No!

In fact, in the cases listed here, they are merely the realities in working in a collaborative environment
<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. Can we not lend 15 minutes to perform a code review for a colleague? Should we skip 
answering a question from an intern because it would interrupt our current work? 

Even if meetings are a drag<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> and you don't have any of the aforementioned, would you permit being 
interrupted for a `P0` bug? Of course!

I think we should celebrate interruptions rather than demonize them. Yes, retrospectives are valuable even though I 
haven't finished my current story. Of course, I will teach you about mime types, rising sophomore intern, instead of just
using the term in context. Give me a minutes to finish what I'm typing<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>, but then *yes*, I'll 
review your PR.
