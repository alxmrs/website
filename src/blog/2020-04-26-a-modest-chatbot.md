title: A Modest Chatbot Design

I used to work for a startup company called [Aira](https://aira.io/). It was a remote assistance platform for the blind 
and low vision. While working on their AI team, I had the opportunity to build out the company's voice user interface.
Aira's use case for a VUI, or chatbot, was ideal. Graphic user interfaces (GUIs) for our customer base would be reduced 
to a VUI since they predominantly interfaced with technology through screen readers. Why not cut out the 
middleman and create the voice interface directly? 

I'm proud of the solution that my team and I built. It was SO much fun to build! It was so fun to build that to this 
day, my mind wanders about how I would build a better system given different constraints and new knowledge. This post 
(or series of posts? We'll see...) discusses the approaches that I would take today in building a comparable solution.
