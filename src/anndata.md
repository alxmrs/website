`anndata` i.e. Annotated data is a NumFOCUS-supported Python package that handles annotated data matricies on memory and disk, and is between Pandas and Xarray.

> Without going into every fancy Python-based data structure, we think that still today no other alternative really exists that:
>
>- Handles sparsity
>- Handles unstructured data
>- Handles observation- and feature-level metadata
>- Is user-friendly
