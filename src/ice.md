A new meditation: 

Let ice melt on your tongue. 

Feel the cold on your palate. 

Watch the pain fade into an electric buzz, 

as you inhale a dragon's breath.

Fight the nervous impulse to chew.

Notice when you _are_ chewing, when you

became lost in a thought. Let the fragments

return you to the moment.

[Taste](smoothie.md) the present.
