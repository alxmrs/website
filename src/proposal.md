I like surprises, but [Camille](https://camille.merose.com) doesn't. She'd rather be able to look forward to things. For
her, half the pleasure of enjoying, say, a vacation comes purely from its anticipation.

I had a challenge before me: How could I give Cam the biggest surprise of her life while also letting her look forward
to it?

I originally had the idea to propose to Camille around the end of year holidays. Every year, a few days leading up to
Christmas, Camille's family take a trip to the cabins of Yosemite valley. Proposals at Yosemite Christmas, in the Cary
family, are practically an unofficial tradition. Unfortunately for me, the [engagement ring](/wedding/ring/)
I had picked out needed more time to be made. And, wouldn't it be nice to pave my own way? While a proposal in front of
family is great, I wanted the moment to honor the character of our relationship.

Christmas' day of 2019, I acted super weird. I let on that I was giving Camille a Big Gift™, the vibes of which she
definitely picked up on. I am not a good liar. You should see my total absence of a poker face when we play cards at
Yosemite Christmas [[1]](#1). The way I pulled off authentic engagement-ring-under-the-tree energy was by giving Camille
a trip for Christmas. I gave her a vacation to New Orleans for the start of Mardi Gras, over Valentines Day weekend.

Camille and I love jazz. Since we got together in 2012, music has been a cornerstone of our relationship. And, as you
can [probably guess](/pesto/), Camille and I love food. For these reasons (and the allure of gator tours), Cam and I
have talked about going to New Orleans together for forever.

"I was sure that he was going to propose in New Orleans," Grandma Shirley would tell us later. I'm glad I gave off that
impression. I had something different in mind.

When we landed in Oakland, we ended up living nearby the
[Mountain View Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View_Cemetery_(Oakland,_California)) [[2]](#2). If
you're not familiar with [the area](https://goo.gl/maps/9aeAdYfmShjbVVva9), the cemetery acts somewhat like a public
park. It has a stunning view of the San Francisco Bay, including parts of the Bay Bridge. Camille and I would often find
ourselves taking a stroll in the cemetery while talking about our lives. We would go there with a pad of paper whenever
we needed to make a big decision, ornate headstones being our preferred backdrop to make defining choices. Along the way
of figuring out the right [engagement ring](/wedding/ring/), I knew that I wanted to propose to Camille here.

The day of the proposal was like any other day – except I dressed nicer than usual and was very nervous. I had to
overcome what felt like a bunch of wrenches thrown at me to get the timing just right. It was a Friday, a week before
Valentines day, and half a week from our vacation to New Orleans. Camille was attending an all
weekend [WFR](https://www.wildmed.com/course-type/wilderness-first-responder/) training, so I was running out of time. I
had just gotten the engagement ring in my hands Thursday, after months of planning. Now, it was go time. All I had to do
was convince Camille to take a walk with me in the cemetery after work.

Camille didn't want to go! Another complication: She was training for a half-marathon, which included a weekly 10-mile
run, which she had taken _that day_. Why was I making her go on walk? Couldn't we just stay at the house and hang out?

I had to think fast to come up with a good excuse. "No, let's go on a walk so we can talk shit about our roommates," I
told her. She was down.

We gossiped as we strolled down the Ave. I don't remember how the conversation shifted when we got to the cemetery. All
I remember is that it was sunset when I popped down on one knee. My proposal speech was a remembrance of when we first
started dating, and she asked me where our relationship was going. I had flown across the world to see her in New
Zealand, only four months into being an item. We were in a car, and it was raining. Back then, I told her that we were
choosing each other every day. In the cemetery, almost eight years later, I told her that I want to choose her for the
rest of my life.

The rest of the evening was a dream. We went to happy hour at [Wine on Piedmont](https://wineonpiedmont.com/), as was
our traditional Friday night activity. I got a reservation at the excellent sicilian place on our block. We had an
exciting trip to look forward to. I got my wish – Cam was surprised.
