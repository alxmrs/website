## 2019-04-14 Algebra Book Exercise:
Based on Printer's Algebra, pg 20, exercise C:
Write a program that uses a unit tests approach to test if "operations" have certain qualities. The ones listed are communativity, associativity, identity, and invertability.
The first set of operators are all the ops in a 2-valued set (should be 16 possible combinations). 

Next step: Adapt the code s.t. it works on more than 2 valued sets. 
Better still: Adapt the code s.t. it works on arbitrary operators.
