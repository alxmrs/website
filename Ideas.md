## 2019-07-10 Advice for undergraduates that emailed me.
So far, I've been cold emailed by not one, but two (!) undergraduates from UCSD. Look, Ma, I'm famous!

They've written to me asking for advice, generally in the pattern of "I'm at A, how do I get to B"? 
I have already written an email to the first one, but have not had the time to respond to the second (it came today). 

After I email / chat this latest solicitor, I think I'll clean up and publish the posts for all to read. 

## 2019-04-14 Algebra Book Exercise:
Based on Printer's Algebra, pg 29, exercise C:
Write a program that uses a unit tests approach to test if "operations" have certain qualities. The ones listed are communativity, associativity, identity, and invertability.
The first set of operators are all the ops in a 2-valued set (should be 16 possible combinations). 

Next step: Adapt the code s.t. it works on more than 2 valued sets. 
Better still: Adapt the code s.t. it works on arbitrary operators.
