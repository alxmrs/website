![CI](https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/website/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

The source code for [alexrosengarten.com](https://alexrosengarten.com).

## What's this website all about?

It's a place for me to cross reference public profiles, host assets like profile pics, and occasionally share my 
thoughts (usually on programming).

## Setup
- [Install Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- `bin/build`

See my [`pandoc-website-template`](https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/pandoc-website-template) project.

## I got here from a comment in my browser's dev tools... now what?

I dunno. You and I are both in unexplored territory here. Maybe... star this repo?
