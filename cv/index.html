Research</h2>
<p>2021 - 2023. Remote, CA</p>
<p><em>Anthromet is on a mission to make weather information universally
accessible and useful. It does this by enabling the development of
state-of-the-art AI forecasts and integrating them into
products.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/weather-tools">Weather Tools</a>,
a set of data pipelines to make weather data universally accessible and
useful. <em>(Apache Beam, Xarray, Google Earth Engine, Google BigQuery,
MetView)</em>. Originally a 20% effort, I grew the project to a team of
8 engineers to serve ~22 research and product teams across Google AI,
Brain, X, DeepMind and Cloud. Some highlights:
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/">GraphCast</a>:
these tools enabled DeepMind to ingest and regrid ERA5, the dataset
behind their autoregressive graph neural network. At the time of
publishing, this was the SOTA 10 day weather forecast, beating physics
based models. GraphCast was published in Science and has ushered in a
new generation of AI-based weather forecasting. The model is being
adopted by ECMWF.</li>
<li><a
href="https://blog.research.google/2023/11/metnet-3-state-of-art-neural-weather.html">MetNet
v3 &amp; Nowcasting in Google Search</a>: MetNet is the world’s leading
Nowcast, or 24 hour, minute by minute weather forecast at 1-4 km
resolution. Weather-Tools were used to ingest a global weather training
and validation dataset for the development of this model as well as for
production inference in Google Search (especially in the EU).
<code>weather-mv</code> focuses on ingesting weather data into Google
Earth Engine in batch and in real time.</li>
<li><a href="https://sites.research.google/contrails/">Project
Contrails</a>. I provided critical weather data and data engineering
pipelines that made this project possible. This project alone will solve
1% of anthropogenic climate change by reducing solar irradiance from
airplanes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5">ARCO-ERA5</a>
&amp; <a
href="https://sites.research.google/weatherbench/">Weatherbench2</a>: I
ingested and published the two biggest datasets in Google Cloud’s Public
Dataset program. These petabytes of data were cloud optimized as Zarr. I
worked with Cloud to shape weather tools to ingest ERA5 into Google
BigQuery.</li>
<li><a
href="https://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html">SEEDS</a>.
Provided data coordinate and support for this GenAI ensemble weather
forecast (diffusion modeling). SEEDS makes it possible to predict rarer
weather events or predict at higher resolutions over physics based
methods since the ML approach creates a surplus of compute.</li>
<li><a
href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/machine-learning-can-boost-the-value-of-wind-energy/">DeepMind’s
Wind Energy optimization</a>. By ingesting weather data from the ECMWF
into Google BigQuery, I was able to help create an ML model with
DeepMind and Cloud to make wind energy more profitable in the Texas
energy grid. This was the original 20% project motivating weather tools.
The ECMWF data and ingestion system lead to a ~3% improvement of mean
absolute zero error compared to benchmarks. This led to ~$7 million more
in revenue over 8 months from wind power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a
href="https://sites.research.google/weatherbench/">Weatherbench2</a>.
WB2 is the definitive benchmark to fairly compare AI-based, mid-range
weather forecasts. This is ushering in a new generation of ML weather
forecasting. <em>(Xarray, Apache Beam, Zarr)</em>
<ul>
<li>Besides ingesting the fundamental datasets (see above), I made core
updates to Xarray-Beam, the underlying engine behind the benchmark.</li>
<li>Contributed code to the benchmark itself, helping ship it to
production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/Xee">Xee</a>: An Xarray backend
for Google Earth Engine. <em>(Xarray, Google Earth Engine)</em>
<ul>
<li>Creator of this package. Launched as a keynote feature of Geo for
Good 2023.</li>
<li>This bridges Google Earth Engine and the scientific Python
communities (i.e. Xarray users).</li>
<li>Internally, this was a key component of a weather research platform
to create new weather models and help put them into production.</li>
<li>Between 2023-10-11 and 2024-08-07, Xee received <a
href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/xee">52k downloads, including 8k
downloads a month</a> on Pip.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google-research/arco-era5">ARCO-ERA5</a>
&amp; <a href="https://pangeo-forge.org/">Pangeo Forge</a>. <em>(Apache
Beam, Xarray, Zarr)</em>
<ul>
<li>Pangeo Forge is aiming to become the conda-forge of scientific
datasets, or open ecosystem of data engineering recipes for producing
cloud-optimized, analysis ready data.</li>
<li>I was the impetus for the Pangeo Forge Project to transition their
data engineering core system to Apache Beam.</li>
<li>I contributed bug fixes and the Beam integration upstream to Pangeo
Forge to produce ARCO-ERA5.</li>
<li>ARCO-ERA5 is the biggest dataset in cloud public datasets, at 3-6
petabytes. It represents the most accurate history of weather on Earth
from 1940 to the present.</li>
<li>We produced cloud optimized and analysis ready data in the Zarr
format, making this critical dataset accessible to everyone (especially,
ML algorithms).</li>
<li>To support the Pangeo Forge project, I contributed Dask runner
support to the Apache Beam project (<a
href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uGEQkws1Low">presented at PyData
NYC</a>).</li>
<li>Pangeo Forge would go on to cloud optimize over 4,000 CMIP6 datasets
via Apache Beam.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Awards and recognition received while on Anthromet:
<ul>
<li>Google Research’s Science Award for <em>Best Collaboration</em>,
along with my team and several partner teams.</li>
<li>A Greenie award from Anthropocene, an internal grassroots
organization focused on climate technologies.</li>
<li>A spot bonus from John Platt, the head of Google Applied Sciences,
for speeding up a critical data ingestion workflow by a few orders of
magnitude.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lead a team of twelve 20%-engineers to make contributions to the
weather community, including internal changes to Google Earth Engine and
open source changes to Weather Tools.</li>
